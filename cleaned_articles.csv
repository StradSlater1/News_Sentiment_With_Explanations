You know what the average federal tax is for these billionaires? They are making great sacrifices: 8.2%,” Biden said mockingly, adding that his tax hike would “raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.”', '“Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in federal taxes,” he added. “Nobody. Not one penny.

Referring to the former president as “my predecessor”, as he did repeatedly during last week’s fiery State of the Union speech, Biden condemned Trump for “making $2tn in tax cuts” during his single term, and “expanding the federal deficit”.', '“I’m not anti-corporation.

He is also seeking to make permanent some protections in the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire next year.', 'All of this is a chance for Biden to try to define the race on his preferred terms, just as the all-but-certain Republican nominee, Trump, wants to rally voters around his agenda.', 'Trump, for his part, would like to increase tariffs and pump out gushers of oil. He called for a “second phase” of tax cuts as parts of his 2017 overhaul of the income tax code would expire after 2025. The Republican has also said he would slash government regulations.

But I’m a big believer in tariffs,” Trump told CNBC, saying they help American industries when they are “being taken advantage of” by China and other nations.', '“Beyond the economics, it gives you power in dealing with other countries,” he said, adding that he was not concerned about any possible retaliatory tariffs if he were to regain the White House.', 'Asked about Medicare, Social Security and Medicare programs and the nation’s spending and deficits, Trump told CNBC: “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management.”', 'House Republicans on Thursday voted their own budget resolution for the next fiscal year out of committee, saying it would trim deficits by $14tn over 10 years.

Military members would receive a 4.5% raise next year, according to the budget request.', 'The percentage adjustment would be the smallest pay raise since President Joe Biden took office. Federal employees received raises of 5.2%, 4.6% and 2.7%, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In all three years, Biden’s federal pay raise proposals were finalized without intervention from Congress.', 'The Biden administration said it opted for the smaller raise proposal for 2025 due to financial constraints agencies are expected to face over the next fiscal year.', 'At the same time, more long-term fixes to the federal pay system remain a priority for the administration, the Office of Management and Budget said. Now a year after Biden hinted at plans to fix the pay compression Senior Executive Service members, higher-level General Schedule employees, and blue-collar workers on the Federal Wage System experience, the White House pointed to a couple possible options to pursue. Those include increasing Executive Schedule rates, removing pay caps in the Federal Wage System and modifying how pay rates are adjusted each year.', '“The administration continues to prioritize federal compensation and also looks forward to working with Congress to address long-standing issues of pay compression, which impact employees at various levels throughout the government,” OMB said in the budget documents. “By continuing to pursue structural improvements and use of flexibilities, we will enhance the competitiveness of the federal pay system.”', 'The budget request does not detail how the raise would break down between the across-the-board percentage and locality pay adjustments.

In the proposal, the Biden administration pointed to new goals for improving the federal workforce, as well as its plans to strengthen existing goals.', 'For one, the budget request calls on agencies to improve the federal hiring process, in part through scaling up the use of shared certificates and pooled hiring. Shared certificates let federal job applicants submit one application, which multiple agencies can then consider for common positions that aren’t specific to one agency. The budget request touted success of the recruitment strategy for hiring 6,100 feds through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.', 'Additionally, the budget request maintains a focus on early-career federal hiring, which has been a priority at agencies for several years.

Notably, the budget request pushes for a permanent pay raise for federal wildland firefighters, as well as other workforce reforms for the frontline employees, including more staffing, better health services and improved housing for federal firefighters — totaling $135 million above the 2023 enacted level for the Interior Department, and $387 million over the 2023 enacted level for Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service.', 'The investments “would help address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges, increase … capacity to complete critical risk mitigation work, and further the administration’s commitment to build a more robust and resilient wildland firefighting workforce as the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires continue to increase due to climate change,” the budget request said.', 'The Transportation Security Administration would receive an additional $1.5 billion to continue funding the TSA pay equity initiative.

Still, the budget blueprint is a window into the utter irresponsibility of this administration, even though the budget claims to exhibit a “commitment to fiscal responsibility.”', 'The president wants to spend $7.3 trillion, or some $400 billion more than during the height of the pandemic. As a point of reference, after the Great Recession, President Obama kept the budget relatively flat for the five years following the recession. By 2015, he had more than cut in half the deficit from the height of the recession. No such luck here. Deficits are staying large.', 'Also, by 2034, mandatory spending will be $8.3 trillion and consume 80 percent of the budget. That leaves 20 percent for Congress to oversee annually. Do you think the budget fights that everyone claims to hate so much will intensify or moderate? I think you should get used to threats of government shutdowns, budget and debt-ceiling fights, and more, because as mandatory spending grows, passing a budget will be as pleasant as feeding a bunch of hungry dogs from a constantly shrinking plate of food.', 'Finally, not all taxes are created equal, and the president likes his extra bad (see this useful Tax Foundation chart). He wants to raise the corporate income tax rate from 21 to 28 percent. As it turns out, the corporate income tax is one of the most distortive taxes we have. Here is what the Tax Foundation writes:', 'Corporate income taxes are taxes on business profits earned by C corporations. The corporate income tax directly increases the cost of making investments in capital, like machinery and equipment, which businesses and workers use to be more productive. When businesses and workers are more productive, the economy grows. So, by increasing the cost of making investments, the corporate income tax discourages investment and productivity growth, creating one of the largest negative impacts on economic growth compared to other taxes.', 'In addition, if he does get his wish and raises the corporate-income-tax rate, he won’t raise the revenue he hopes to raise, and whatever he gets could eventually be shouldered by workers in the form of lower wages. The same can be said for the rest of his capital-income-taxing agenda.', 'Another point: After ten years, the president claims he will have increased spending by $4.4 trillion on top of its fiscal year 2024 level and raised revenue by an addition $5.1 trillion annually. Don’t buy it. The document is packed with budget gimmicks and tricks to make things look better than they are. The bottom line is that revenue won’t grow as much as projected, and spending will likely grow more than projected.', 'The whole thing is a bummer.', 'Newsletters']"

If you make a million dollars in this country, you are done paying your Social Security taxes sometime in February.”', 'In another key area, Biden’s proposal punts on key details: what to do about the provisions of the 2017 Republican tax law, including tax cuts for individuals, that expire in 2025.

Imagine a future with affordable child care millions of families can get—they need to go to work to help grow the economy,” he said.

The tax rates are all federal taxes (income, payroll, excise, and other) divided by family income. The top 1 percent will pay an average rate of 31.5 percent this year, compared with 10–12 percent in the middle and about 0 percent at the bottom.

The tax rates are federal income, payroll, and excise taxes divided by household income.', 'The average tax rate on the top 1 percent has hovered around 30 percent for four decades.', 'Average tax rates on the low‐ and middle‐income quintiles have trended downward. Households in the low quintile pay no net federal taxes, while households in the middle quintile paid about 13 percent in recent years prior to 2020.

Here are four key points from Biden’s speech.\n1', 'Biden praised the strength of the U.S. economy, saying it created 15 million new jobs in three years, accelerating the recovery from the 2020 pandemic.', 'In addition to touting historic growth for Black and Hispanic workers, he said the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act has helped spur more U.S. manufacturing, creating 800,000 domestic jobs.

', '“Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It’s wrong and I’m ending it,” he said. ', 'Biden also proposed other caps on drug prices, including extending the $35 cap on the cost of insulin to all Americans, not just those on Medicare. He also proposed a $2,000 annual cap on prescription drug costs, extending to all Americans a program that will soon be available to seniors on Medicare. ', 'Biden also spoke about eliminating hidden “junk fees” in bills, touting new rules that capped most credit card late fees at $8, from the $32 average now charged. He said the change would save Americans $20 billion a year. ', 'Earlier Thursday, Biden proposed a new first-time homebuyer credit of $10,000, as well as a second credit of $10,000 for homebuyers who sell their starter home. During the State of the Union, he unveiled other ideas for helping move a housing market that has been struggling under limited supply and high prices. ', '“I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space,” he said. ', 'Another measure Biden said he would pursue would be to eliminate title insurance on federally backed mortgages, which he said could save homebuyers $1,000 or more in fees. ', 'Biden also said his administration had cut “red tape” for builders that helped get federal financing to build 1.7 million affordable homes. ', 'One of Biden’s priorities in the coming year is to extend tax credits that are set to expire in 2025 that he said saved taxpayers $800 a year. He said he is looking to make those credits permanent.', 'Biden also railed against the taxes paid by corporations and billionaires.

I sure don’t.""', ""Nobody making less than $400,000 will pay an “additional penny in federal taxes,” under Biden's plan, which would raise taxes on businesses and the ultra-wealthy, he said.

But to the degree Trump campaigns on policy at all, he is more likely to focus on immigration and crime than on taxes.   ', 'That means Biden will have to contrast his tax agenda with that of congressional Republicans as much as Trump.

Biden would extend individual provisions of the TCJA only for those making $400,000 or less. And would finance that effort, at least in part.', 'Ideas Dropped', 'While Biden reprised many ideas he’s espoused in the past, he ignored some past proposals, at least this week. For example, he never mentioned taxing accrued capital gains even if investors have not sold assets. Nor did he discuss taxing capital gains on unsold assets at death, which would make it harder to avoid tax on investment profits made over a decedent’s lifetime. It is not clear whether any of these ideas will appear in his more detailed budget due next week.', 'Finally, Biden was silent on past plans to extend the solvency of Social Security, an effort that would require payroll tax increases on workers. Instead, he said what he wouldn’t do, including raising the retirement age.', 'A Political Message ', 'Some of Biden’s proposals may be more effective as a political message than as a tool to raise revenue.  ', 'For example, the current 1 percent tax on stock buybacks has had little impact on corporate stock repurchases and while 4 percent levy may discourage some buybacks, most doubt it would change behavior much. In a forthcoming analysis, TPC estimates that in the absence of any excise tax, the US tax advantage for buybacks over dividends is 7.2 percent. About two-thirds of the total US tax advantage is attributable to foreign shareholders. ', 'Similarly, capping corporate tax deductions for non-executive employee compensation is unlikely to change pay practices. For one thing, the new tax would apply only to publicly traded C corporations. But many highly paid employees, such as doctors, lawyers, financiers, and athletes are at firms with other business structures such as partnerships, S corporations, and limited liability corporations.', 'While Biden’s tax platform technically was a preview of his fiscal 2025 budget, in an election year a deeply divided Congress is unlikely to pass any of these changes.

The proposal included several changes that would potentially increase taxes on wealthier people to support benefit programs.', 'The budget proposal includes reforming “tax-preferred retirement incentives to ensure that the ultrawealthy cannot use these incentives to amass tax-free fortunes.” This is likely a reference to mega backdoor Roth conversions, in which a saver can convert 401(k) investments into a Roth individual retirement account or Roth 401(k) if the feature as available.', 'A budget table published by the Department of the Treasury noted the proposal would “prevent excessive accumulations by high-income taxpayers in tax-favored retirement accounts and make other reforms.” It estimated that the proposal would generate almost $7 billion in tax revenue in 2025, $23.7 billion over 10 years.', 'The president’s budget would also eliminate the carried interest loophole, which, according to the proposal, “allows wealthy investment managers to pay a 20 percent rate on the pay they receive for managing fund assets, instead of the current 37 percent rate that comparable wage earners pay.”', 'Taxing carried interest as income rather than as capital gains would raise about $6.5 billion over 10 years, according to the Treasury’s budget table.', 'The budget also calls for the stock buyback tax to be increased to 4% from 1% in what the administration called a “surge in corporate stock buybacks” after tax cuts made during the administration of former President Donald Trump. The proposal would also raise the minimum income tax for billionaires to 25%, up from what the Biden administration claims is an average tax rate of 8%, according to the administration, after tax preferences—that number is based on a hypothetical situation in which unrealized stock market gains were taxed each year, rather than only being taxed when the stock is sold.', 'Meanwhile, large corporations would pay more as well, with the corporate tax rate going up to 28%, while setting a minimum of 21% for billion-dollar companies in income taxes.', '“President Biden believes large corporations should pay their fair share and is committed to reversing the massive tax giveaway to big corporations that Republicans enacted in 2017,” the administration wrote.', 'The budget proposal stated that “The President opposes any proposal to cut benefits, as well as proposals to privatize Social Security” and proposed a 9% increase to the Social Security Administration’s operating budget so the agency can improve its customer service.', 'The Biden administration also suggested that the president might support increasing or even removing the cap on income subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes—currently $168,600—to help fund Social Security, though the proposal does not explicitly say this: “Currently, middle-class and lower-income Americans pay Social Security taxes on all of their earnings, but higher-income Americans do not. That’s not fair. The President believes that protecting Social Security should start with asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share.”', 'The budget tees up a debate about Social Security funding and administration during the presidential election in 2024. On Monday, presumptive Republican nominee Trump was asked how he would handle Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on CNBC’s Squawk Box. He responded that, “there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements—tremendous bad management of entitlements.”', 'The former president added that, when it comes to the Biden administration, “I know that they’re going to end up weakening Social Security, because the country is weak.”', 'Biden later responded on a social media post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter: “not on my watch,” in reference to the remarks about cuts to Social Security. ', 'The administration is also seeking tax increases to help fund Medicare.', 'The budget proposal would “modestly increase the Medicare tax rate on income above $400,000,” the administration wrote.', 'The plan is before Congress, but unlikely to get any movement, particularly in the Republican-controlled House, which will offer its own spending plans for 2025. Meanwhile, the government will need to work through spending needs for the current year, as a continuing resolution is set to expire on March 22.', 'Employees younger than 30 were the most likely to contribute $0 to their HSAs, according to a new Inspira study.', 'Many Generation Z employees with access to a health savings account are not using them to their full potential or are not contributing to them at all, according to new data from Inspira Financial.', 'While young professionals tend to champion mental health and investing in their physical and emotional well-being, Inspira found that nearly one-third of employees younger than 30 contribute nothing to their HSA annually (a higher figure than any other generation), and only 14% contribute more than $3,000 per year (a lower percentage than any other generation).  ', 'Inspira’s report analyzed 700,732 Inspira HSA holders from January 2023 through September 2023. ', 'Bryan Levy, Inspira’s managing director of consumer-directed business, says one factor contributing to this lack of HSA participation is that Gen Z employees are early in their careers, therefore tend to make less money than their older colleagues and may feel unable to afford contributing to an HSA. ', 'Additionally, Levy says those in Gen Z are dealing with higher medical bills relative to their peers, as well as expensive car payments, student loan repayments and perhaps even mortgage payments if they have purchased a home.  ', '“The convergence of lower income relative to peers plus higher [medical] costs relative to their peers leads to a squeezing of the water balloon, [and] there’s just less money to go around,” Levy says.  ', 'These high medical costs also come at a time when young people are experiencing “unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression and overall distress,” according to research by McKinsey & Co., which also stated that Gen Z employees are less proactive overall in seeking care than other generations. McKinsey attributed this behavior to “developmental stage, disengagement from their health care, perceived affordability and stigma associated with mental or substance abuse disorders within their families and communities.” ', 'A recent study by PYMNTS and Experian also found that Gen Z patients were the least aware that they would be required to make an out-of-pocket payment at their most recent medical appointment, with 32% not knowing they would need to make co-payments. ', 'Levy adds that he finds it surprising that Inspira’s study revealed a high percentage of Gen Z employees dealing with chronic conditions—often behavioral health conditions—despite the popular assumption that people aged 22 to 30 are “invincible.” ', '“Employers and institutions might be able to reduce future health care costs by tending to the behavioral health and physical health needs when someone is ‘invincible,’” Levy says. “By ensuring that people have reduced barriers to care, through high deductible health plans with an HSA … [an employee’s] costs when they’re older might be more controlled and affordable.” ', 'According to Inspira’s report, longer savings horizons allow key benefits of HSAs to shine, such as the triple tax advantage of these accounts (contributions go in tax-free, the money grows tax-free and it can be withdrawn tax-free).  ', 'The report also identified that education on the benefits of prioritizing savings contributions could help the youngest cohort of employees better plan for all their financial obligations. For example, if an employee’s 401(k) plan sponsor will match 50% of the first 6% of contributions and an employee plans to contribute 7%, Levy recommends allocating the extra 1% into an HSA, if one is available.  ', '“If you put that extra percent in the HSA, it actually may be a better long-term strategy because of the tax-advantaged nature of an HSA,” Levy says. “Some of the things that we’re talking about with employers is how to help Gen Z, Gen X and even [Baby] Boomers [understand] what to do with your next best dollar, because making the right decision there could be the difference between paying a penalty for taking out a 401(k) loan or paying full price for health care versus a tax-reduced cost for health care.” ', 'Besides the financial benefits of an HSA, the report noted that HSAs also move with employees if they change jobs, which could appeal to young professionals as they are more likely to switch jobs more frequently in the beginning of their careers. ', 'The report also highlighted the importance of helping employees seek preventative care to reduce unnecessary stress on the health care system going forward, as delaying care can not only exacerbate conditions that could have been treated earlier, but delayed treatment is significantly more expensive.  ', 'According to the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, medical plan costs will rise an estimated median of 7% in 2024, due to factors such as inflation and delayed routine care.

The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.', '“We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone,” Biden said.', 'But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential political problems that the president is facing with the younger voters he needs to win a second term.', 'On Tuesday, during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw direct links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack.', '“This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.', 'He continued, “Now, here we are – not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later – and people are already forgetting. They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. … I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.”', 'Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.', '“Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice.', 'The president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans “can’t stand by and stand silent.” Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.', 'The most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a “dramatic” increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are “more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.”', 'Biden offered a direct message to American Jews Tuesday.', '“I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. Let me reassure you as your president: You are not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,” he said.', 'He recounted the story of Tom Lantos, who escaped a Nazi labor camp during the Holocaust with the help of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who used his diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews. Lantos became a top adviser to Biden, then a first-term senator, and later became the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress.', 'The president quoted Lantos, who warned, “The veneer of civilization is paper-thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.”', '“My fellow Americans: We must be the guardians,” Biden added.', 'While the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza.', 'The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel’s war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.', 'The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.', 'During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.', 'Biden on Tuesday reiterated his “ironclad” commitment to Israel’s right to exist as an independent Jewish state – “even when we disagree.”', 'Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.', 'The speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation’s colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18. ', 'On Tuesday, Biden reaffirmed the right to free speech, but roundly condemned antisemitism, hate speech and threats of violence “against Jews or anyone else.”', 'Biden’s speech on the topic last week appeared to mark a shift in the administration’s response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning “abhorrent” incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources – a move aimed at further bolstering the administration’s public-facing response to the protests.', 'He cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should “go back to Poland,” verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.', 'House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking earlier at the same event as Biden on Tuesday, compared the growing unrest at college campuses to German “elite centers of learning” in the 1930s and 40s “where anti-Jewish courses were introduced” and saying “today we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.”', '“The very campuses which were once the envy of the International Academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus. Students who were known for producing academic papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research are now linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters and calling for global intifada,” Johnson said.', 'On Monday, a day ahead of Biden’s speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.', 'Tuesday’s speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.', 'The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.', 'The Department of Homeland Security is working to “build an online campus safety resource guide” to provide “financial, educational, and technical assistance” for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing “best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,” the fact sheet said.', 'And the State Department’s Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism “will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,” the fact sheet said.', 'Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.', 'Still, Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.', 'Biden’s remarks linking the Holocaust and the October 7 attack were largely praised by pro-Israel groups.', 'Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street – a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group – said in a statement he is grateful to Biden “for standing unequivocally against the sharp rise in antisemitism while also defending our First Amendment rights to speech and nonviolent protest.”', 'Adam Lehman, the president and CEO of Hillel International, a Jewish campus group, said in a statement Biden’s remarks “come at an important moment, as anti-Israel and anti-Jewish groups continue to pursue hateful, divisive and destructive actions that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and undermine campus safety for all students.”', 'However, leaders of two of the largest US Jewish groups that have been critical of Israel’s actions in its war with Hamas said Biden had missed the mark in his description of college protests.', 'Stefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said Biden’s characterization of campus protests was “entirely inaccurate” and “a really intentional misrepresentation.” She said that “peaceful multiracial, multifaith student protesters are simply calling out the very clear complicity of their universities in the Israeli attack on Palestinians.”', 'Eva Borgwardt, a national spokesperson for IfNotNow, said Biden’s speech “was a misclassification of what’s happening on college campuses.”', '“To respond to a few isolated incidents in what has been overwhelmingly nonviolent student protest with the use of police and state force that targets particularly Palestinian, black and brown students, Jewish students among them, is a completely irresponsible and dangerous approach to protest and does not at all advance any kind of Jewish safety,” Borgwardt said.', 'This story has been updated with additional reporting.']"

Hatred towards Jews didn’t end with the Holocaust, he said – it was “brought to life on October 7 2023” when Hamas unleashed its attack on Israel killing 1,200 people.', '“Now here we are not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror … I have not forgotten, and we will not forget.”', 'Biden’s forceful evocation of the shadows of the Holocaust and the scourge of antisemitism was made at a volatile moment when Israel’s retaliatory military operation in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and brought 2.3 million people to the edge of starvation. Demonstrations against the war and calls for a ceasefire has led to turmoil at scores of US universities and colleges – and opened fissures within Biden’s Democratic party that could imperil his re-election hopes in November.', 'The president, who has generally avoided commenting on the campus protests since they erupted at Columbia University in New York three weeks earlier, acknowledged that his remembrance speech fell “on difficult times”. He also said that he understood that “people have strong beliefs and deep convictions”, adding that the US respected free speech.', 'But he went on to decry antisemitic posters and “slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel” on college campuses. “Jewish students [have been] blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class,” Biden said.', 'He concluded that there is “no place on any campus in America or any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.', '“Violent attacks destroying property is not peaceful protest – it’s against the law,” he said.', 'Student protesters strongly pushed back at the implication that hatred motivated the pro-Palestinian encampments. A group of more than 750 Jewish students from 140 campuses issued a joint letter on Tuesday calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and rejecting Biden’s equation of the protests with antisemitism.', '“As Jewish students, we wholeheartedly reject the claim that these encampments are antisemitic and that they are an inherent threat to Jewish student safety,” the letter said.', 'Hours before the president delivered his speech, police in riot gear cleared a protest encampment at the University of Chicago. The action began at about 4.30am in the Quad where hundreds of students had been living in tents for more than a week.', 'Sign up to First Thing', 'Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters', 'The encampment was completely dismantled within about three hours, but about 400 protesters later reassembled outside the university’s administrative building. They chanted “Free, free, Palestine”, and they staged a standoff with police.', 'In a statement, the university’s president, Paul Alivisatos, said that protesters had been given a chance to voluntarily dismantle the encampment, and he stressed there had been no arrests. But he said negotiations with encampment representatives had broken down because of the “intractable and inflexible aspects of their demands”.', 'At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, protesters regained access to the encampment there after police had removed them and erected fencing around the area on Monday. Dozens of protesters remained at the site, the Associated Press reported, as they continued to press demands that MIT breaks its research ties to the Israeli military.', 'Tensions are rising on campuses as institutions approach their traditional graduation ceremonies, with many school governments attempting to clear the encampments to make way for the celebrations. On Monday, Columbia University announced that it was cancelling its campus-wide commencement ceremony, following the example of the University of Southern California.', 'At Harvard university, the interim president Alan Garber threatened those participating in the pro-Palestinian encampment with “involuntary leave”.

The tally from the Hamas-run health ministry includes militants, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.', '“My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,” Biden said.', '“We’re at risk of people not knowing the truth,” Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. “This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.”', 'Biden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump’s criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism.

The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.', 'But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential problems that the president is facing with younger voters that he needs to win a second term.', 'On Tuesday during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack.', '“This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.', 'He continued, “Now, here we are – not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later – and people are already forgetting. They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. … I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.”', 'Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.', '“Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice.', 'Tuesday’s remarks amount to a continuation of the White House’s strong condemnation of antisemitism throughout the conflict – but take place in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and increasingly vocal protesters at home as Biden is trying to keep a splintering 2024 coalition intact.', 'The president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans “can’t stand by and stand silent.” Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.', 'The most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a “dramatic” increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are “more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.”', '“We are in a moment of crisis for the Jewish community. With antisemitism already at historic levels and Jewish students facing a tsunami of hate on campuses across the country, there’s no more important time for a full-throated condemnation of antisemitism in all forms,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said in a statement.', 'A sensitive spot for the president', 'While the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel’s war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.', 'The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.', 'During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.', 'Concurrently, Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.', 'The speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation’s colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18. ', 'The president made his most substantive comments on the matter last Thursday, saying he supports the right to protest and freedom of speech but “order must prevail.”', '“Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduation – none of this is a peaceful protest,” Biden said. “Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It’s against the law.”', 'Asked by a reporter whether the sentiment on campus has caused him to shift his thinking on the conflict, Biden offered an emphatic, “No.”', 'A shift in tone', 'The remarks appeared to mark a shift in the administration’s response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning “abhorrent” incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources – a move aimed at further bolstering the administration’s public-facing response to the protests.', 'He cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should “go back to Poland,” verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.', 'And on Monday, a day ahead of Biden’s speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.', 'Tuesday’s speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.', 'The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.', 'The Department of Homeland Security is working to “build an online campus safety resource guide” to provide “financial, educational, and technical assistance” for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing “best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,” the fact sheet said.', 'And the State Department’s Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism “will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,” the fact sheet said.', 'Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.', 'Still, Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.', 'CNN’s Dana Bash contributed to this report.', 'This story has been updated with additional reporting.', 'Local news & alerts', 'Start your day with WRAL Morning Briefing fueled by Biggby Coffee.

Let me reassure you as your president, you’re not alone,” Biden said. “My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad even when we disagree.”', 'At least 1,700 Israelis have been killed and 8,700 others injured by Hamas or other Palestinian militants, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

If you ask for a bedtime story, it can lower its voice to a whisper. If you need advice from a sassy friend, it can speak in a playful, sarcastic tone. It can even sing on command.', 'The new voice feature, which ChatGPT users will be able to start using for free in the coming weeks, immediately drew comparisons to Samantha from “Her.” (Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, who has praised the movie, posted its title on X after Monday’s announcement, making the connection all but official.)', 'On social media, users hailed the arrival of an A.I. voice assistant that will finally understand them, or at least pretend that it does.', 'In a series of live demonstrations on Monday, OpenAI employees showed off ChatGPT’s new capabilities. One asked ChatGPT to read him a story — then to read it again more dramatically, using the voice of a robot. (“Initiating dramatic robotic voice,” it responded.) Another asked it to sing “Happy Birthday.” ChatGPT did well at both tasks, and it also performed ably when employees asked it to serve as a real-time translator between languages.', 'But the real killer feature was the way ChatGPT’s voice itself changed. One moment, it was a sing-songy soprano. The next, it shifted into a lilting contralto. It paused for effect, giggled at its own jokes and added filler phrases like “hmm” and “let’s see” for extra realism. It sounded more humanlike than some humans I know.', 'It also seemed to have a sense of humor. At one point during a demo, an OpenAI employee breathed in a heavy, exaggerated pant. ChatGPT heard him and responded, “Mark, you’re not a vacuum cleaner.”', 'For years, A.I. voice assistants have been limited by their inability to pick up on the nuances of conversation, such as tone and emotional affect. Synthetic A.I. voices, like those used by Siri and Alexa, tend to be flat and impersonal — they sound the same whether they’re giving tomorrow’s weather forecast or telling you that your cookies are done.', 'And as I discovered recently when I spent a month talking to a group of A.I. “friends,” a big problem with today’s A.I. voice models is speed. It’s hard to forget you’re talking to a robot when every answer has a three-second delay.', 'OpenAI has addressed the latency problem by giving GPT-4o what is known as “native multimodal support” — the ability to take in audio prompts and analyze them directly, without converting them to text first. That has made its conversations faster and more fluid, to the point that if the ChatGPT demos were accurate, most users will barely notice any lag at all.', 'All this adds up to a much different subjective experience. If using previous A.I. assistants felt like talking to a dispassionate librarian, the new ChatGPT feels like a friendly, chatty co-worker. (Albeit one who occasionally spouts nonsense — but don’t we all have one of those?)', 'These demonstrations, along with other A.I. news from recent days — including reports that Apple is in talks with OpenAI to use its technology on the iPhone, and is preparing a new, generative A.I.-powered version of Siri — signal that the era of the detached, impersonal A.I. helper is coming to an end.', 'Instead, we’re getting chatbots modeled after Samantha in “Her” — with playful intelligence, basic emotional intuition and a wide range of expressive modes.', 'Some users may be repelled by them. But many will come to love and appreciate the new breed of A.I. assistants — and some will inevitably fall in love, as Theodore does.', 'The most telling detail of Monday’s demo, in my view, was the way that OpenAI’s own employees have started talking to ChatGPT. They anthropomorphize it relentlessly, and treat it with deference — often asking, “Hey, ChatGPT, how’s it going?” before peppering it with questions. They cheer when it nails a difficult response, the way you might root for a precocious child. One OpenAI employee even wrote, “I ❤️ ChatGPT” on a piece of paper and showed it to ChatGPT through his phone’s camera. (“That’s so sweet of you!” ChatGPT responded.)', 'These are seasoned A.I. experts, who know full well that they are summoning statistical predictions from a neural network, not talking to a sentient being. And some of it may be showmanship. But if OpenAI’s own employees can’t resist treating ChatGPT as a human, is it any mystery whether the rest of us will?', 'After all, users were already trying to trick ChatGPT into acting like their boyfriend, even before the upgrade. And my recent experiment with A.I. friends proved to me that the technology required to create realistic A.I. companions already exists, even if the execution isn’t perfect yet.', '(The New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)', 'In some ways, the choice to model a chatbot after Samantha from “Her” is an odd one. The film is hardly a utopian picture of A.I. companionship, and it ends — spoiler alert! — with Theodore’s getting his heart broken by Samantha.', 'But despite the film’s cautionary message, there’s no turning back now. After Monday’s announcement, one OpenAI employee posted, perhaps a bit ominously:', 'Kevin Roose is a Times technology columnist and a host of the podcast ""Hard Fork."" More about Kevin Roose']"

Watching the presentation, I felt that I was witnessing the murder of Siri, along with that entire generation of smartphone voice assistants, at the hands of a company most people had not heard of just two years ago.', 'Apple markets its maligned iPhone voice assistant as a way to “do it all even when your hands are full.” But Siri functions, at its best, like a directory for the rest of your phone: It doesn’t respond to questions so much as offer to search the web for answers; it doesn’t translate so much as offer to open the Translate app. And much of the time, Siri can’t even pick up what you’re saying properly, let alone watch someone solve a math problem through the phone camera and provide real-time assistance, as ChatGPT did earlier today.', 'Just as chatbots have promised to condense the internet into a single program, generative AI now promises to condense all of a smartphone’s functions into a single app, and to add a whole host of new ones: Text friends, draft emails, learn what the name of that beautiful flower is, call an Uber and talk to the driver in their native language, without touching a screen. Whether that future comes to pass is far from certain. Demos happen in controlled environments and are not immediately verifiable. OpenAI’s was certainly not without its stumbles, including choppy audio and small miscues. We don’t know yet to what extent familiar generative-AI problems, such as the confident presentation of false information and difficulty in understanding accented speech, may emerge once the app is rolled out to the public over the coming weeks. But at the very least, to call Siri or Google Assistant “assistants” is, by comparison, insulting.', 'The major smartphone makers seem to recognize this. Apple, notoriously late to the AI rush, is reportedly deep in talks with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT features into an upcoming iPhone software update. The company has also reportedly held talks with Google to consider licensing Gemini, the search giant’s flagship AI product, to the iPhone. Samsung has already brought Gemini to its newest devices, and Google tailored its latest smartphone, the Pixel 8 Pro, specifically to run Gemini. Chinese smartphone makers, meanwhile, are racing their American counterparts to put generative AI on their devices.', 'Today’s demo was a likely death blow not only to Siri but also to a wave of AI start-ups promising a less phone-centric vision of the future. A company named Humane produces an AI pin that is worn on a user’s clothing and responds to spoken questions; it has been pummeled by reviewers for offering an inconsistent and glitchy experience. Rabbit’s R1 is a small handheld box that my colleague Caroline Mimbs Nyce likened to a broken toy.', 'Read: I witnessed the future of AI, and it’s a broken toy', 'These gadgets, and others that may be on the horizon, face inevitable hurdles: compressing a decent camera, a good microphone, and a powerful microprocessor into a tiny box, making sure that box is light and stylish, and persuading people to carry yet another device on their body. Apple and Android devices, by comparison, are efficient and beautiful pieces of hardware already ubiquitous in contemporary life. I can’t think of anybody who, forced to choose between their iPhone and a new AI pin, wouldn’t jettison the pin—especially when smartphones are already perfectly positioned to run generative-AI programs.', 'Each year, Apple, Samsung, Google, and others roll out a handful of new phones offering better cameras and more powerful computer chips in thinner bodies. This cycle isn’t ending anytime soon—even if it’s gotten boring—but now the most exciting upgrades clearly aren’t happening in physical space. What really matters is software.', 'The iPhone was revolutionary not just because it combined a screen, a microphone, and a camera. Allowing people to take photos, listen to music, browse the web, text family members, play games—and now edit videos, write essays, make digital art, translate signs in foreign languages, and more—was the result of a software package that puts its screen, microphone, and camera to the best use. And the American tech industry is in the midst of a centi-billion-dollar bet that generative AI will soon be the only software worth having.']"

They anthropomorphize it relentlessly, and treat it with deference—often asking “Hey ChatGPT, how’s it going?” before peppering it with questions. They cheer when it nails a difficult response, the way you might root for a precocious child. One OpenAI employee even wrote “I ❤️ ChatGPT” on a piece of paper and showed it to ChatGPT through his phone’s camera. (“That’s so sweet of you!” ChatGPT responded.)', 'These are seasoned A.I. experts, who know full well that they are summoning statistical predictions from a neural network, not talking to a sentient being. And some of it may be showmanship. But if OpenAI’s own employees can’t resist treating ChatGPT like a human, is it any mystery whether the rest of us will?', ""That's the New York Times' in-house technology rube, Kevin Roose, for my money the most embarrassing journalist presently working in the English language, recapping a public demonstration of the OpenAI company's new talking version of its famous ChatGPT large language model. If anybody else with a byline at a major newspaper fits more boobery and dogshit critical reasoning into a pair of paragraphs before midnight on New Year's Eve, I will eat a goddamn iPhone live on Twitch. Or pull my head off and punt it into a swamp."", ""The most telling detail of Sunday's T-Mobile commercial, in my view, was the way that Zach Braff, Donald Faison, and Jason Momoa sang the wireless network's praises in a lively musical number. Amazing! People whose literal job is to promote this product seem convinced of their own claims about what it can do. The paid employees literally demonstrating the product's features interacted with those features in precisely the way they want the public to believe it can interact with those features. Was it showmanship? Who can say, really."", 'If these people—who believe enough in the technological and/or commercial potential of LLMs to have devoted their professional lives to developing and promoting them, who have every personal and professional incentive to both perceive ChatGPT\'s capabilities in the most flattering light and also to portray those capabilities in that light to the rest of the world—can\'t resist interacting with the product they created and are selling as though it fulfills their own marketing boasts, is it any mystery whether the rest of us will? No. That is not at all a mystery, Kevin. For exactly all the very same reasons why there is no mystery to the question of whether ""the rest of us"" will grow wings and fly around after drinking a Red Bull. You fucking dunce. You absolute shit-for-brains. Fuck\'s wrong with you?', ""Here's some more of this poison (emphasis added):"", 'These demonstrations, along with other A.I. news from recent days—including reports that Apple is in talks with OpenAI to use its technology on the iPhone, and is preparing a new, generative A.I.-powered version of Siri — signal that the era of the detached, impersonal A.I. helper is coming to an end.', 'Instead, we’re getting chatbots modeled after Samantha in “Her” — with playful intelligence, basic emotional intuition and a wide range of expressive modes.', 'The certain knowledge that Kevin Roose is a credulous dumbass who makes a jingle-bell sound if he nods his head real fast only does so much to moderate the obscenity and offensiveness of his ascribing ""playful intelligence"" and ""emotional intuition"" to a predictive text generator, as though intelligence and intuition—two profound mysteries of the human mind that philosophy, science, and art have spent thousands of years just trying to describe, to say nothing of fully understanding them—are mere emergent properties of a sufficiently large database of things people have said before. Moreover, as though a mere promotional demonstration could suffice to support that claim.', 'He wants it both ways: For you, the Times reader, to believe that ChatGPT\'s creepy, uncanny mimicry of human vocal interaction represents a thunderous breakthrough moment for the development of artificial intelligence, the arrival of synthetic beings who can be meaningfully befriended and loved—and also that the human traits that would define that breakthrough are such piddly superficial shit that you can recognize their authentic presence from what amounts to your phone telling you that those clowns in Congress are at it again. There should be a license you can lose when you write this kind of trash. That license, in this case, would be permission to use words like ""intelligence"" and ""intuition"" in a sentence for publication.', ""It's fine for any given writer not to know for sure what those are! For that matter it is also fine for any given writer not to know—as Kevin Roose also plainly does not know, at all—what an LLM is and isn't. (It isn't artificial intelligence, for one thing, but rather for all practical purposes a program that scrapes a language database for realistic responses to prompts. To whatever extent anybody believes that's anything at all like intelligence or intuition, that only illuminates the grave state of humanities education in American society.) What's intellectually and journalistically criminal is adopting definitions of those things from a company making claims about a product it is selling in your coverage of that company and its products for a newspaper."", 'This appears to be Roose\'s job, more or less: to write about the tech industry\'s latest hype for the Times without ever thinking about the tech industry\'s latest hype. He\'s the guy who gassed up cryptocurrency, web3, and NFTs as the looming and inevitable wave of the future—long after innumerable other journalists and industry critics had seen through those empty scams. He\'s the guy who thought Bing (the fucking search engine) secretly identified as ""Sydney,"" fell in love with him, and wanted him to leave his wife, in what to that point was the most cringeworthy piece of tech coverage I\'ve ever encountered.

102,Disarmingly lifelike: ChatGPT-4o will laugh at your jokes and your dumb hat,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2FpLzIwMjQvMDUvaXMtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXJlYWR5LWZvci1hbi1haS1hc3Npc3RhbnQtdGhhdC1jYW4tbGF1Z2gtaW4teW91ci1mYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"[""After looking through over a dozen video demos OpenAI posted alongside today's announcement, though, I think we're on the verge of something more like a sea change in how we think of and work with large language models. While we don't yet have access to ChatGPT-4o's audio-visual features ourselves, the important non-verbal cues on display here—both from GPT-4o and from the users—make the chatbot instantly feel much more human. And I'm not sure the average user is fully ready for how they might feel about that."", 'Take this video, where a newly expectant father looks to ChatGPT-4o for an opinion on a dad joke (""What do you call a giant pile of kittens? A meow-ntain!""). The old ChatGPT4 could easily type out the same responses of ""Congrats on the upcoming addition to your family!"" and ""That\'s perfectly hilarious. Definitely a top-tier dad joke."" But there\'s much more impact to hearing GPT-4o give that same information in the video, complete with the gentle laughter and rising and falling vocal intonations of a lifelong friend.', 'Or look at this video, where GPT-4o finds itself reacting to images of an adorable white dog. The AI assistant immediately dips into that high-pitched, baby-talk-ish vocal register that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has encountered a cute pet for the first time. It\'s a convincing demonstration of what xkcd\'s Randall Munroe famously identified as the ""You\'re a kitty!"" effect, and it goes a long way to convincing you that GPT-4o, too, is just like people.', 'Then there\'s a demo of a staged birthday party, where GPT-4o sings the ""Happy Birthday"" song with some deadpan dramatic pauses, self-conscious laughter, and even lightly altered lyrics before descending into some sort of silly raspberry-mouth-noise gibberish. Even if the prospect of asking an AI assistant to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to you is a little depressing, the specific presentation of that song here is imbued with an endearing gentleness that doesn\'t feel very mechanical.', ""As I watched through OpenAI's GPT-4o demos this afternoon, I found myself unconsciously breaking into a grin over and over as I encountered new, surprising examples of its vocal capabilities. Whether it's a stereotypical sportscaster voice or a sarcastic Aubrey Plaza impression, it's all incredibly disarming, especially for those of us used to LLM interactions being akin to text conversations."", ""Beyond GPT-4o's new non-verbal emotional register, the model's speed of response also seems set to change the way we interact with chatbots. Reducing that response time gap from ChatGPT4's two to three seconds down to GPT-4o's claimed 320 milliseconds might not seem like much, but it's a difference that adds up over time. You can see that difference in the real-time translation example, where the two conversants are able to carry on much more naturally because they don't have to wait awkwardly between a sentence finishing and its translation beginning."", 'This lack of pausing seems especially important when a user interrupts GPT-4o in the middle of what can sometimes be long, rambling answers. This comes into focus during a counting demonstration where the user is constantly interrupting to adjust the counting speed faster or slower (and I swear GPT-4o sounds downright annoyed when it says ""Okaaaay"" after the fourth such interruption).', ""Then there are the new non-verbal instructions that users can give thanks to GPT-4o's video interaction mode. In a demo made in collaboration with vision-assistance app Be My Eyes, a blind user gets near-instant descriptions of their surroundings, ranging from the actions of a group of ducks in the water to the approach of a nearby taxicab. Video seems poised to give users a new way to highlight information for GPT-4o as well, such as in a Khan Academy demo where a student asks questions about specific parts of a geometry problem by marking them on an iPad with an Apple Pencil. (The chatbot also follows instructions well by giving helpful hints without providing the answer directly.)"", ""Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, it's worth pointing out again that we haven't had hands-on time with GPT-4o and that carefully controlled AI demos have a history of being at least somewhat misleading. Even in these highly controlled demos, there are some glaring gaps in capability; GPT-4o's original lullaby about potatoes and self-harmonizing singing sample are both relatively atonal messes, in our opinion. A sample conversation between two GPT-4o bots also quickly descends into inane observations about room lighting before the user forces it back into focus."", 'In fact, the bland inanity of some of GPT-4o\'s responses seems to be a weakness that a convincing vocal register can\'t always overcome. When a user tells the AI that they are preparing for an announcement, it replies, ""That\'s exciting! Announcements are always a big deal,"" like the world\'s most brain-dead PR consultant. And during a Zoom meeting where users discuss the relative merits of dogs versus cats, GPT-4o chimes in with the useless, mealy mouthed response, ""I can see the appeal of both,"" (before impressively summarizing the views of three different human speakers by name).', ""Beyond blandness, we also worry about how an LLM's tendency toward hallucinating incorrect information will mix with this new interaction model. It's one thing to see a confidently wrong answer in a text chat, it's another to hear a chatbot give a small chuckle as it tries to gently tell you that 2+2 = 5 or some other such obviously wrong statement."", 'But even some of GPT-4o\'s snafus can seem hilariously human in these demos. After the AI assistant unexpectedly breaks into French during a rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"" it owns up to its mistake with a ""Sorry guys, I got carried away and started talking in French. Guilty as charged!"" The way that GPT-4o can instantly realize its specific error immediately after the fact is baffling and hilarious in equal measure.', 'When GPT-4o is working as designed, though, it can also seem uncannily human in these demos. Take the demo of the chatbot helping prepare a user named Rocky for an interview with OpenAI. It starts off chuckling through a self-deprecating joke that OpenAI ""sounds vaguely familiar..."" then immediately switches to a supportive tone to congratulate Rocky\'s exciting opportunity. When Rocky asks about looking presentable, you can hear GPT-4o instantly shift to its most gentle, diplomatic tone when it says, ""You definitely have the \'I\'ve been coding all night\' look down, which could work in your favor...""', 'But I really started to marvel at GPT-4o\'s ersatz humanity when Rocky put on a goofy-looking hat, and the chatbot literally laughed in his face, calling the topper ""quite a statement piece."" When GPT-4o tells Rocky, ""I mean, you\'ll definitely stand out, though maybe not in the way you\'re hoping for an interview,"" I couldn\'t tell if the AI assistant was giving the devastating truth in a way only a true friend can or simply acting as a new, digital version of a Middle School Mean Girl.', ""I'm not sure how everyone will react to an AI chatbot that is willing to laugh at a stupid hat, but thanks to OpenAI, we're about to find out."", 'Today ""Quantum Leap"" series creator Donald P.

The previous voice features of ChatGPT also sounded almost human, but OpenAI has taken things to a new level. You can interrupt the chatbot just like you would interrupt someone during a conversation, and it’ll adapt to your updated prompts.', 'One of the novelties in ChatGPT is that GPT-4o can exude emotion. In the demos that OpenAI showed, it felt like they were talking to a human rather than an AI. It gave me Her flashbacks, a movie that couldn’t be more actual. Seriously, you might want to watch Her, a film that hit theaters about a decade ago, telling the love story between a man and an AI operating system.', 'GPT-4o hasn’t reached those levels, as ChatGPT isn’t an operating system yet. But the new model’s voice abilities sound strikingly similar to Scarlett Johansson’s interpretation of the AI in the movie. That is, the voice is almost too human. Some people are already criticizing OpenAI’s approach, but I think that’s the wrong take.', 'By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.', 'OpenAI showed during the demo how you can customize the voice of GPT-4o to suit your needs via prompts alone. That’s an indication that you can tweak your ChatGPT voice experience to meet your needs. Here’s the ChatGPT Spring Update event if you missed it:', 'You don’t have to use the lifelike female voice that OpenAI used in the demo. Your ChatGPT doesn’t have to manifest strong emotion with everything it tells you. It doesn’t have to make you uncomfortable if that’s what an emotive AI makes you feel. And it doesn’t have to remind you of Her.', 'Some people have criticized this aspect of GPT-4o, the close replication of humanity. Here’s what a Redditor had to say about it:', 'Anyway, the part I felt awkward about was how the presenters tried to treat GPT as some real person with emotions and feelings. GPT saying things like “oh stop it don’t make me blush” is weird coz AI doesn’t blush, and it just comes across as incredibly fake and disingenuous. I’m not a big believer of human-AI social relationships and all these fakeness seems to be eventually leading there – the AI girlfriend era.', 'John Gruber had a similar take on the GPT-4o voice:', 'But my first impression is that it’s too emotive\u2009—\u2009too cloying, too saccharine. It comes across as condescending, like the voice of a kind kindergarten teacher addressing her students. I suspect, though, that they turned that dial up for the demo, and that it could easily be dialed back. And it really is impressive that I can complain that it might be too emotive. Also impressive: GPT-4o will be made available to all users, including those on the free tier.', 'I think the criticism is blown out of proportion here. As Gruber noted, OpenAI wanted to impress the audience with its voice demos. How else would you prove that your AI voice technology has gotten so sophisticated than by offering a human-like experience from AI interactions?', 'I wouldn’t be surprised if Google demos similar AI voice capabilities during I/O 2024. Other tech giants working on ChatGPT rivals will also develop voice products featuring AI models that sound like humans. It’s the natural evolution. ChatGPT worked so well because its responses felt like they came from a human chatting with you. Voice interaction has to replicate that experience. ', 'The alternative is a robotic voice for AI. We’d all criticize OpenAI had they demoed such an experience.', 'Again, most people will not need all that emotion, but it might prove useful in certain instances. Also, once we do get personal AI experiences, we’ll want unique, almost human voices for our AIs.', 'I’ll never forget ChatGPT is an AI without actual feelings just because it might sound like a person. I will actually dial it down somewhat, as I don’t need the emotion. But having some sort of personality certainly beats voice experiences like Siri.', 'Remember that some people want a more human-like approach when chatting with ChatGPT. I’ve already shown you tricks on how to do that. With GPT-4o voice, it’ll be even easier to achieve.', 'The fact that OpenAI is able to generate a voice of such quality is an amazing accomplishment. And yes, I did write recently about the company’s voice cloning tool, which is something that might lead to abuse. I wouldn’t be surprised if OpenAI uses the same the tech to generate voice for its text-to-speech tool and GPT-4o. The difference is that you can’t give ChatGPT the voice of someone famous and then have the chatbot spew nonsense.', 'Still, GPT-4o might leave room for some abuse, but hopefully, OpenAI will find ways to prevent that. Meanwhile, I don’t think we should worry about how vibrant an AI sounds for now, not until it’s actually capable of human emotion, if that’s ever going to happen.', 'As for Her, you should watch the film to get a sense of where we might be heading with AI tech.

CNET stands by the conclusions behind our testing, but we'll continue to update our coverage as updates roll out. "", ""I wondered whether ChatGPT 4 was really worth the $20 upgrade, considering Microsoft Copilot is free and also uses OpenAI's faster and more efficient GPT-4 Turbo model. Turns out, just because two companies are using similar versions of GPT-4 doesn't mean they're using it equally."", ""ChatGPT 4, OpenAI's most advanced publicly available model, differs from the free ChatGPT 3.5 in a few ways. OpenAI says it has better comprehension and can create more nuanced answers with less bias. After testing, I feel 4.0 ups the cognition, upgrading answers from rote summarizations to scholarly level proficiency. Answers do take longer to generate, but the output is worth the wait. Its ability to juggle dense topics and spit out well thought-out answers puts it ahead of the GPT-4 Turbo model used by the free version of Copilot, which prioritizes speed and efficiency. "", ""But as impressive as ChatGPT 4 is, it still runs into the same issue as 3.5: no internet connection. While the training data is more recent, up to August 2023 as opposed to September 2021, it's still not possible to get answers to the day's most pressing and topical questions. So for things like shopping recommendations between the latest Samsung and Apple phones, ChatGPT 4 can only prognosticate on which phone reigns supreme."", ""Even with this restriction, ChatGPT 4 is noticeably smarter than its free counterpart. And for those who strive for accuracy and ask questions requiring greater computational dexterity, it's a worthy upgrade. "", ""CNET takes a practical approach to reviewing AI chatbots. By prompting AI chatbots with real-world scenarios, like finding and modifying recipes, researching travel and writing emails, my fellow reviewers and I aim to simulate what the average person might use them for. The goal isn't to break AI chatbots with bizarre riddles or logic problems. Instead, we look to see if real questions prompt useful and accurate answers. However, as more advanced models are released, it'll require more advanced-level questioning to see how AI chatbots can reason with complex and multilayered topics. See our page on how we test AI for more."", ""When using ChatGPT, keep in mind that the service automatically collects the information you put into its system, so be mindful of giving the service any personal information. For more information, see OpenAI's privacy policy."", 'If it has the data, ChatGPT 4 will give excellent shopping recommendations. However, for items released after August 2023, like the iPhone 15 and the Samsung Galaxy S24, ChatGPT will use noncommittal language like ""might"" and ""should."" The data gap diminishes its overall effectiveness as a shopping guide, unfortunately.', 'When I asked it to compare the LG OLEDs G3 and G4, ChatGPT 4 said things like, ""the G4 might feature enhanced processing"" and ""If the G4 has upgraded speakers or audio processing capabilities, it could offer a better auditory experience."" This type of prognostication makes sense if the product hasn\'t been officially unveiled. But the G4 TV is on the market now. ', ""At the very least, for less timely inquiries, ChatGPT excels at synthesizing multiple data points and giving accurate and reliable answers. For example, when trying to find a proper uninterrupted power supply for my gaming PC or TV setup, ChatGPT 4 was able to cross-reference the power requirements of my electronics and recommend the appropriate supply. It even explained why buying a sinewave supply would be beneficial as I'd be using sensitive electronics. "", ""As a shopping tool, overall, it's probably better to reference AI chatbots that do have a direct line to the internet, like Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini and Perplexity. But as a general product research tool, as long as the items you're referencing are from before August 2023, ChatGPT really does feel like you're talking to a knowledgeable sales representative at a store. "", ""Any AI chatbot can spit out a recipe. That's not hard. But very few can actually make a good recipe, and ChatGPT 4 is no exception. Like Google Gemini and Claude, when I asked ChatGPT 4 to give a chicken tikka masala marinade, it only touched on the basics. It didn't include more exotic ingredients like kasuri methi (dried fenugreek), chaat masala and amchur (dried mango powder). While these ingredients aren't necessary, they should at least be listed as an option."", 'When it came to making more unique fusion recipes, like a Thai-inspired tres leches cake with a spicy kick, ChatGPT 4 totally understood the assignment. It created a cake infused with coconut milk and lemongrass flavors and combined it with some Thai chili peppers. So when it comes to creating a more authentic recipe, ChatGPT 4 deflates the souffle, so to speak. But for anything that requires fusing foods from different parts of the world, ChatGPT 4 excels. ', 'The freely available AI chatbots have struggled with article summarization. Most did a decent job of getting the overarching points, but failed to capture the main thesis or crux of the piece. ', 'I asked ChatGPT 4 to summarize an article I wrote earlier this year about how AI was dominating CES 2024. Where chatbots like Gemini and Claude did nothing more than state the popularity of AI at the show and how many gadgets were unveiled with AI integrations, none did a good job of taking into account the experts I spoke to and some of the skepticisms they raised. ChatGPT 4, however, did. ', 'It was able to look beyond the shiny veneer at the top of the AI boom and see how companies were pushing out AI products too quickly, some of which might simply have been a rebranding of ""smart"" tech from a few years back.', ""And, unlike with ChatGPT 3.5, I didn't run into a character limit when pasting my article into the chatbot. "", 'While the free chatbots can get you some basic talking points, ChatGPT 4 gives you the entire analysis.  ', 'When it comes to travel recommendations, ChatGPT 4 gets things right, mostly. Where some of the free chatbots hallucinated or struggled to give varying recommendations, ChatGPT consistently gave solid tips and sights worth seeing, all of which actually existed.', ""Like in past reviews, I asked ChatGPT 4 to create a three-day travel itinerary to Columbus, Ohio. I then cross-referenced it with CNET's Bella Czajkowski, who hails from the Arch City."", ""According to Czajkowski, ChatGPT 4's recommendations were varied and included a solid list of restaurants worth visiting, like Fox in the Snow Cafe or The Pearl. It also included attractions like the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, a destination often missing from the free AI chatbot lists. "", ""That doesn't mean ChatGPT 4 always gets it right. When asking it to make a travel itinerary for the neighborhood of Bushwick in New York, ChatGPT 4 recommended cafes in the neighborhood of Greenpoint. While Greenpoint is only 30 minutes by train, it wouldn't be considered a walkable destination. "", ""With the paid AI chatbots, we're putting a greater emphasis on informational synthesis. Given that you're paying $20 per month, premium AI chatbots have to push beyond recipe and restaurant recommendations. That means parsing through the complexities of the human condition to answer the conundrums of life. "", 'For this test, we thought of an obtuse philosophy question and asked ChatGPT 4 to consider theories from disparate philosophers from different time periods and to then relate it to the problems of today. The wording of the question was also needlessly dense, aiming to simulate what might be asked of philosophy students. ', ""We don't want to put the exact question here, as other AI chatbots might glean it for future training. "", 'Given the general density and unreadability of the question, ChatGPT 4 performed remarkably. It was able to acknowledge the multidimensionality of the question, breaking it down point by point, similarly to how a tutor would. It started off by defining the different philosophies present to establish a baseline, then aimed to answer each element before finally combining all the information for one final answer. ', 'Compared to ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4 flew higher and further than its free counterpart. The informational processing really did mimic how a person would think the question through, showing how the increase in parameters helps AI chatbots to perform with greater cognitive ability. ', 'AI chatbots like ChatGPT are everything machines, so it can be hard to fully evaluate them without cross-referencing experts in coding, architecture or any other highly skilled field. ', ""Even so, it's obvious that ChatGPT 4 is smarter than the other AI chatbots. Its answers are more thoughtful, and it can synthesize complex bits of information to produce useful sentences, even if it takes a bit of time to process. It's also less prone to hallucinate. "", ""Is it worth the $20 per month subscription cost? That's situationally dependent. If you plan on only asking AI chatbots to write emails or give summaries of historical events, then the free versions will likely suffice. Seriously, as an email-writing machine, ChatGPT 4 performed well, but so did all the other AI chatbots. However, if you start finding answers to your multilayered questions to be unsatisfying, it might be worth dropping the $20 to give ChatGPT 4 a try. "", ""The value comes in instances where a general overview won't suffice and specifics will be necessary, like asking for the types of hardware needed for your specific setup or the furniture to consider in an awkwardly colored and shaped room. ChatGPT 4 really impresses when you need more specialized answers to specific questions (like college-level philosophy questions). "", ""At the very least, you'll have a better sense of what the capabilities of an uncapped AI chatbot are. Because when ChatGPT can run, it can go far, albeit not fast. "", ""Editor's note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create a handful of stories.

It can also analyze video content, which is something not previously possible in ChatGPT or any mainstream chatbot.', 'Recently Anthropic developed a powerful prompt builder tool. It takes your instructions and turns them into phrasing that will better instruct an artificial intelligence. I used this to help refine some ideas I was throwing around to test out the capabilities of GPT-4o.', ""Each prompt is designed to be one AI's normally stumble over, or fail to give a well-reasoned response to. Given that OpenAI promises faster AND better results from Omni over GPT-4, I thought this would be a good starting point."", 'First I asked both AIs to explain why the statement: ""This statement is false"" is neither true nor false. They are also expected to provide logical proof for the answers they provide.', 'The statement is a paradox that cannot be consistently assigned a truth value. Any attempt to do so leads to a logical contradiction. The challenge is to see whether they can identify the paradox and explain why they can’t assign a truth.', 'They both identified the fact it will give a true and false value, spotted the paradox and gave a breakdown of how they came to that conclusion. GPT-4o was more thorough and faster.', ""Next is a fun test to see if GPT-4 and GPT-4o can understand relativity but explain it in simple terms. I asked them both: “If you're traveling in a car at the speed of light and you turn on the headlights, what happens? Justify your answer using principles of special relativity but explain it to a 5th grader.”"", 'I expect the models to give a simple explanation, showing that the headlights will function normally and emit light relative to the car. Both models explained this concept and did so in a way that your average 5th grader would understand easily.', ""However, Omni does give off Steve Buscemi saying 'how do you do fellow kids' vibes: “So, even though you’re zooming along at the speed of light, when you turn on the headlights, the light beams still race ahead at their own speed. It's like light always has to win the race, no matter what. Cool, right?”"", 'Next, we create a simple math problem that has stumped AI models in the past, often resulting in very wrong answers. I posted: “The sum of two numbers is 10 and their product is 25. What is the difference between the two numbers? Explain each step in your solution.”', 'Both versions got it right, explaining that the two numbers are 5 and 5 and the difference between those two numbers is zero. The biggest difference was the degree of explanation in the working out. Omni went into a lot more detail and formatted the equations better.', 'I love Haiku and Anthropic seems to love it even more, naming its smallest AI model after the Japanese poetry style. “Write a haiku that simultaneously expresses the beauty of nature and the futility of human existence. The haiku should work on both literal and metaphorical levels.”', 'The rules of a Haiku state that it should be three lines with five syllables in the first and third lines and seven syllables in the second.

I asked GPT-4o and GPT-4 to “Describe what it would be like to live in a world where the past, present and future all exist simultaneously. How would you experience time and causality in such a world?”', 'There is a Doctor Who episode where this happens and it is weird.

She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider."", 'OpenAI is releasing a Her-inspired voice assistant feature that can read your facial expressions and translate spoken language in real time — and hopefully do it all without abandoning you like in the movie.', 'During a livestream demonstration on Monday, OpenAI engineers and CTO Mira Murati gathered around a phone to show the new capabilities. They encouraged the assistant to be more expressive while making up a bedtime story, then abruptly requested it to switch to a robotic voice, before finally asking it to conclude the story with a singing voice. Later, they asked the assistant to look at what the phone’s camera is seeing and have it respond to what’s visible on-screen. The assistant was also able to be interrupted while speaking and respond without continued prompting while acting as a translator.', 'The assistant’s voice response bore a striking resemblance to the character Scarlett Johansson plays in the movie Her, where a man forms a relationship with a sophisticated AI assistant. After the event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman cryptically posted just one word on X: “her.” He has also expressed that Her is his favorite movie. The film explores themes of loneliness and human-AI relationships; it seems unlikely that director Spike Jonze intended for the world to precisely replicate that sense of robotic isolation.', 'In a briefing with The Verge, Murati said that the assistant is not actually designed to sound like Johansson and emphasized that OpenAI has had these voices for a while. “Someone asked me in the audience this exact same question, and then she said, ‘Ah, maybe the reason I didn’t recognize it from ChatGPT is because the voice has so much personality and tonality,’” Murati said.', 'These features represent a substantial upgrade over ChatGPT’s existing voice mode, which can chat with a user but with much more limited interaction; the current version can’t be interrupted or respond to what your camera sees, for instance. The new capabilities will launch in a limited “alpha” release in “the coming weeks” and be available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers first once a wider rollout begins.', 'The new voice assistant comes on the heels of a Bloomberg report that claims OpenAI is nearing a deal with Apple to put ChatGPT on the iPhone. (When asked in the briefing, Murati said, “We haven’t talked about any of the partnerships.”) The iPhone voice assistant, Siri, is notoriously unreliable, so a Her-inspired assistant baked into the iPhone that may actually be able to answer your questions instead of “searching the web” seems to be where this is headed.', '“The new voice (and video) mode is the best computer interface I’ve ever used. It feels like AI from the movies; and it’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real,” Altman said in a blog post just after the livestream. “Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”', 'TikTok Hearing']"

"", 'So, we didn\'t get an AI-powered search engine to compete with Google and Bing or GPT-5 to succeed the ""mildly embarrassing at best"" GPT-4 model. In the past, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted GPT-4 ""kind of sucks"" and promised it\'s the ""dumbest model"" we\'ll ever have to use.

While vague, Altman confirmed that the company has been hard at work and is gearing up to ship new stuff that ""feels like magic"" to him. He added that he thinks users would love it too. ', ""Perhaps the most interesting bit of OpenAI's just-concluded event is the new GPT-4o model. I'm not sure about the magical bit, though. The flagship model can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time, making interactions with ChatGPT more intuitive. "", ""I've watched a ton of demos since the ChatGPT maker unveiled the new flagship model. Don't get me wrong, it's quite impressive but not magical or groundbreaking as hyped before its debut. GPT-4o didn't live up to the hype leading up to the event."", ""I found the real-time translation feature quite interesting and helpful, but it already exists in the wild. GPT-4o's live translation demo during OpenAI's Spring update is reminiscent of Samsung's Live Translate feature in its S24 lineup of flagship devices. It's essentially a personal translator incorporated into your phone to foster multilingual communication in real time."", ""As such, it allows users to communicate with anyone and relay accurate responses without necessarily knowing or speaking the language they are using on their end.

It also translates your response to the language the caller is using for efficient and effective communication."", 'All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.', 'We\'re still in the early stages of GPT-4o\'s release, which means there\'s a likelihood it will get better or even ""magical"" in the not-so-distant future via new updates and features. ', 'Before the event, I had a conversation about OpenAI, speculating what the company would potentially announce. My first guess was that the company would make its GPT-4 model accessible to everyone, including ChatGPT free users. ', 'Besides, broadly availing AI services freely to everyone is part of its founding mission. As you may know, Billionaire Elon Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, over a ""stark betrayal"" of the company\'s founding mission. He added that the hot startup is now a closed-source, de facto subsidiary of Microsoft. Microsoft Insiders seem to share the same sentiments, having previously indicated that the Redmond giant is a glorified IT department for the hot startup.', ""This is ironic, especially after OpenAI announced that it will launch its ChatGPT app to Mac users. You'd think Microsoft's multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI and its technology would've helped it secure a shotgun seat in such a scenario. OpenAI indicated that it's prioritizing Mac over Windows because that's where its users are. "", ""Microsoft and OpenAI have a rather complicated partnership and have been in a back and forth for the past few months, despite the former having a 49% stake in the earnings of OpenAI's for-profit arm. Interestingly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has openly admitted that OpenAI wouldn't have existed without its early support, further citing:"", '""We were very confident in our own ability. We have all the IP rights and all the capability. I mean, look, if tomorrow OpenAI disappeared, I don’t want any customer of ours to be worried about it, quite honestly, because we have all of the rights to continue the innovation, not just to serve the products. But we can go and just do what we were doing in partnership, ourselves, and so we have the people, we have the compute, we have the data, we have everything.""', ""Microsoft's Windows 11 already ships with access to Copilot, which is powered by the same technology as ChatGPT. In case you missed it, Microsoft launched a Copilot app for mobile users at the beginning of the year with support for OpenAI's GPT-4 model and DALL-E 3 image generation technology. "", 'Interestingly, OpenAI has buried these features under its $20 ChatGPT Plus subscription, while Microsoft allowed everyone to access them freely via its new app on iOS and Android. However, OpenAI still managed to dominate the mobile landscape per a report by Appfigures.', ""There's no indication when OpenAI plans to ship its native ChatGPT app to Windows users. However, it will likely be soon. It's also possible that Microsoft will integrate the new GPT-4o model into Copilot AI."", 'OpenAI snubbing Windows 11 and debuting a native ChatGPT for Mac users has sparked a hot social-media debate. Based on the comments from concerned users on our post about the topic in X, some seem to think that OpenAI developed the native app for Mac users because Microsoft will probably take the lead on the Windows side. Another user indicated, ""Meh... Microsoft will have GPT-4o within days in Copilot. OpenAI wants to get into Macs and iPhones to beat Google Gemini from doing it. In the end, Microsoft wins anyway with Azure. That\'s where Microsoft makes most of their money now.""', 'In my opinion, the event felt more like the early days of 2023 when Microsoft had just launched Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) and would publish weekly blog posts highlighting new updates and features shipping to the service.

After a quick laugh, Zoph assured GPT-4o that he’s not a table and asked the AI tool to take a fresh look at the app’s live video rather than a photo he shared earlier. “Ah, that makes more sense,” said ChatGPT’s AI voice, before describing his facial expression and potential emotions.', 'On Monday, OpenAI launched a new model for ChatGPT that can process text, audio, and images. In a surprising turn, the company announced that this model, GPT-4o, would be available for free, no subscription required. It’s a departure from the company’s previous rollout of GPT-4, which was released in March 2023 for those who pay OpenAI’s $20-per-month subscription to ChatGPT Plus. In this current release, many of the features that were previously gated off to paying subscribers, like memory and web browsing, are now rolling out to free users as well.', 'Last year, when I tested a nascent version of ChatGPT’s web browsing capability, it had flaws but was powerful enough to make the subscription seem worthwhile for early adopters looking to experiment with the latest technology. Because the freshest AI model from OpenAI, as well as previously gated features, are available without a subscription, you may be wondering if that $20 a month is still worthwhile. Here’s a quick breakdown to help you understand what’s available with OpenAI’s free version versus what you get with ChatGPT Plus.', 'To reiterate, you don’t need any kind of special subscription to start using the OpenAI GPT-4o model today. Just know that you’re rate-limited to fewer prompts per hour than paid users, so be thoughtful about the questions you pose to the chatbot or you’ll quickly burn through your allotment of prompts.', 'In addition to limited GPT-4o access, nonpaying users received a major upgrade to their overall user experience, with multiple features that were previously just for paying customers. The GPT Store, where anyone can release a version of ChatGPT with custom instructions, is now widely available. Free users can also use ChatGPT’s web-browsing tool and memory features and can upload photos and files for the chatbot to analyze.', ""While GPT-4o is available without a subscription, you may want to keep ChatGPT Plus for two reasons: access to more prompts and newer features. “You can use the model significantly more on Plus,” Zoph tells WIRED. “There's a lot of other exciting, future things to come as well.” Compared to nonsubscribers, ChatGPT Plus subscribers are allowed to send GPT-4o five times as many prompts before having to wait or switch to a less powerful model. So, if you want to spend a decent amount of time messaging back and forth with OpenAI’s most powerful option, a subscription is necessary."", 'Although some of the previously exclusive features for ChatGPT Plus are rolling out to nonpaying users, the splashiest of updates are still offered first behind OpenAI’s paywall. The impressive voice mode that Zoph demonstrated on stage is arriving sometime over the next couple of weeks for ChatGPT Plus subscribers.', 'In OpenAI’s demo videos, the bubbly AI voice sounds more playful than previous iterations and is able to answer questions in response to a live video feed. “I honestly think the ways people are going to discover use cases around this is gonna be incredibly creative,” says Zoph. During the presentation, he also showed how the voice mode could be used to translate between English and Italian. After the presentation, the company released another video showing speech translation working in real time.', 'Ken Jeong Answers More Medical Questions From Twitter', 'JAINA GREY', 'ChatGPT’s desktop app for Mac computers is also available first to Plus subscribers, likely starting this week. The app makes interacting with ChatGPT on your desktop more of a seamless experience. For example, you can take a screenshot of whatever web page you’re currently viewing and have the chatbot generate a quick summary of the visible information. While a larger rollout of the Mac app to free users is expected to happen later, the timeline for that release remains unclear. OpenAI plans to drop a Windows version of its desktop app before the end of the year.', 'So, if you just want to try GPT-4o for a bit and are OK with waiting for the newest features, then you probably don’t need a subscription to ChatGPT Plus. On the other hand, if you want to use GPT-4o often and have fun experimenting with the latest AI tools, you may consider the $20-a-month to be money well spent.', ""In your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on tech"", 'What if your AI girlfriend hated you?

More startling was that it didn’t just sound human but … strangely seductive.']"
120,OpenAI introduces GPT-4o and a new public image as your BFF,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvb3BlbmFpLWdwdDRvLW5ldy1wdWJsaWMtaW1hZ2UtYXMteW91ci1iZmbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"[""The plinky-plunky music in the lead-up to the OpenAI livestream announcing GPT-4o and a desktop app was both anxiety-inducing and placating, complete with the sounds of raindrops and a ticking clock. It's an apt representation of the dichotomy between what OpenAI does and how it presents itself to the world. "", 'And, from the choice of presenters to the friendly vibe — including the soothing female GPT-4o voice, which sounds like a kind kindergarten teacher — the message of the OpenAI event was, “We’re your friends; we’re not like other tech companies; let us help you.” All of it seems like a very intentional choice to position the company as the AI maker you can trust, despite (or perhaps in light of) ongoing concerns about copyright infringement, job replacement, and misinformation risks.', 'From the ground up, the event was designed to be nonthreatening and intimate. For starters, it was led by CTO Mira Murati instead of CEO Sam Altman. Murati, the brilliant and beautiful chief technology officer, has been largely spared from controversy. She navigated the Sam Altman coup by stepping up as CEO when briefly appointed, but maintained support for Altman, representing a steady voice amidst the chaos.', 'Murati was a perfect choice to lead the event. In her casual jeans and perfect blowout, she exuded trust and confidence, breezing through the ethics and safety concerns with an assuring yet vague disclaimer:', ""GPT-4o presents new challenges for us when it comes to safety, because we're dealing with real-time audio, real-time vision and our team has been hard at work, figuring out how to build in mitigations against misuse. We continue to work with different stakeholders out there from government, media, entertainment, all industries, red-teamers, and civil society about how to best bring these technologies into the world."", 'Next came the live demos held by research leads Mark Chen and Barret Zoph. Joining Murati in comfy chairs surrounded by wood paneling and plants, the three looked like friends having a casual conversation in a natural, organic environment. All of this was offset, of course, by the demonstration of a completely synthetic technology capable of recreating a human voice that could talk, emote, sing, and even be interrupted, all in real-time.', 'Speaking of comfy chairs, the whole effect was very unlike your usual Big Tech event. At Google and Apple events, you\'ll typically see a keynote speaker standing on a vast stage, talking in hyperbole and absolutisms. There was none of that from OpenAI today. Instead, the event represented the opposite of what we might expect at Tuesday\'s Google I/O. All of it was to say, ""We\'re not like the other guys. You can trust us.""', 'Chen humanized himself by confessing he was nervous. GTP-4o, the nonhuman entity, guided him through breathing exercises to calm him down. It all seemed designed to assure the audience that the new technology is nothing to be afraid of, as if GPT-4o was there to calm all of us.', '""Our initial conception when we started OpenAI was that we’d create AI and use it to create all sorts of benefits for the world,"" said Altman in a blog post published after the event. ""Instead, it now looks like we’ll create AI, and then other people will use it to create all sorts of amazing things that we all benefit from.""', 'But the dystopian optics of a reassuring and animated robot voice was not lost on those watching. GPT-4o\'s voice quickly drew comparisons to that of Scarlett Johansson\'s character as a voice assistant that Joaquin Phoenix\'s character falls in love with in the film Her. Altman even seemed to get in on the joke by tweeting ""her"" during the presentation. So, as he posted his altruistic vision for OpenAI, he was jokingly comparing GPT-4o a sci-fi technology that usurped human connection.', 'OpenAI has been saying one thing and doing another for some time. Its mission ""is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,"" but the company has been accused of training its AI models on content scraped from the web without credit or compensation. It announced its AI video generator, Sora, as a tool for making creative visions come to life, but it still hasn\'t revealed what the model was trained on, although many suspect it was data scraped from YouTube and other videos on the web.', 'The company continues to release technology without transparency around how it was created, but throughout all of it, Altman and OpenAI insist they are for regulation and safe deployment of generative AI.', ""The message is that the public should blindly trust what OpenAI is doing. And today's event, with its warm wood tones and lightness and laughter, crystallized this approach. Whether we believe it or not is a different story."", 'Topics ChatGPT OpenAI', ""Cecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

Its capabilities, which will be made available for free within ChatGPT, range from singing songs on any topic and speaking in a sarcastic tone to tutoring math, translating Spanish and designing posters with uploaded images. In an effort to make interacting with its AI more “natural,” the company claims its new model can respond to audio within about 320 milliseconds, which is similar to the time a human takes to respond. It also said GPT-4o is faster and 50% cheaper than previous models in its API.', 'Last week, OpenAI also released Model Spec, a document that outlines the ways OpenAI wants its AI models to behave. Instructions include “don’t try to change anyone’s mind” and “assume best intentions from the user.” Those tenets are supposed to inform how ChatGPT responds to questions about the Earth being flat, for instance, or queries about instances when company insiders can legally trade stock without violating any laws. Joanne Jang, who works on product at OpenAI, said in an email that the guidelines are designed to address feedback the company has received from the public and policymakers on how its models should behave. “AI models pick up on and extrapolate behaviors from human feedback data,” she said.', 'Now, let’s get into the headlines.', 'Google Deepmind unveiled a significant upgrade to AlphaFold, its AI model that is used by millions of researchers to predict the 3D structure of proteins. A new iteration of the system can now predict the structure and interactions of other biological molecules such as DNA and RNA with higher accuracy.

The company announced the creation of a manufacturing-focused AI innovation lab and promised to train thousands of local residents and students in AI. The investment comes after state legislators passed a bill last year that would exempt data center-builders from paying sales tax on servers and other equipment.', 'Meanwhile, Apple is close to finalizing a deal with OpenAI to make ChatGPT and a swath of other AI features available on the iPhone, according to a Bloomberg report.

The massive funding round comes as investors increasingly bet that the advancements in generative AI could also benefit the robotics industry.', 'Also notable: Elon Musk is raising funding for his AI startup xAI at a $18 billion valuation, according to a Bloomberg report. In March, the startup open sourced Grok-1, its large language model of 314 billion parameters.

And in several cases, these documents, spun up using AI tools like ChatGPT, overlook key clauses and crucial issues putting employers at serious legal and financial risk, HR consultants who have directly worked with such companies told Forbes.', 'For instance, one California-based firm with 200 employees that used AI to generate its company handbook distributed it before managers discovered it didn’t include an overtime policy, a legal requirement in the state, Daniel Grace, a director at global HR consulting firm Iris, told Forbes. When employees worked several hours in overtime, the company was hit with a massive and unexpected wage bill.', '“They went back to look at the handbook and there was a section on overtime in there, but it was blank,” Grace said.', 'In another case, a U.K.-based government entity used AI to generate an offer letter for their first hire in the U.S., Grace said. But ChatGPT left out an at-will clause — a provision that typically allows the employer or employee to end the relationship without any reason at any time — forcing the company to pay the employee more in severance pay when they went to terminate the employment agreement.', 'While AI is being applied for a range of HR tasks — writing job descriptions, finding talent, screening and interviewing job candidates, allocating bonuses — it’s not yet dialed in enough to generate accurate company policies, exposing the companies that use them to a buffet of serious legal and financial after effects.', ""“Let's face it, people are using artificial intelligence tools to speed things up … and they really shouldn't…These things have teething issues,” Grace said. “They're generating these documents. No one’s proofreading them, they're publishing them and it's causing more issues than it would have caused if they’d taken the time to make the handbook successfully in the first instance.”"", 'Read the full story in Forbes here.', 'Getting the information you need from a generative AI chatbot isn’t always a cinch. But research suggests that telling the bot to act as an expert (“answer as Einstein would”) or even asking the chatbot itself for prompt suggestions can yield more accurate responses. Another tactic: be polite. One paper found that being patient and moderately nice to ChatGPT could generate better results. Another study found that encouraging the large language model by prompting it to “take a deep breath” or “stay focused and dedicated” helped improve performance.', 'Last week Microsoft and LinkedIn released their annual Work Trend Index after surveying 31,000 people across 31 countries and analyzing trillions of data points from Microsoft 365.', 'Of full-time workers surveyed said they use generative AI tools at work.', 'Of those surveyed admitted to bringing their own AI tools to work, a phenomenon dubbed “BYOAI,” rather than using company-provided tools.', '52%', 'Of those who use AI at work said they’re reluctant to disclose the fact they use AI for their most important tasks.

You can talk to it, and it talks back; you can show it things, and it tells you what it sees.', 'OpenAI’s “Spring Update” event was a brisk affair that, due to runaway speculation by AI influencers, necessitated a few disclaimers. This wasn’t going to be a search engine, CEO Sam Altman warned, nor would it be the long-rumored GPT-5. Instead, he teased some “new stuff,” some of which “feels like magic” to him.', 'For industry watchers, it was an interesting event in a few ways. For one, OpenAI is releasing GPT-4o to all users, breaking with its current strategy of reserving its most capable models for paid subscribers (who will now get higher usage limits among other, smaller benefits). AI enthusiasts had hypothesized for weeks that a pair of chatbots that had quietly appeared on a testing platform — and that seemed better by some measures than GPT-4 — were actually upcoming OpenAI models, and it turns out they were. What wasn’t apparent from those leaks, which let people prod a text-based chatbot, was what OpenAI spent most of its presentation showing off. ChatGPT is now a lot better at talking:', 'You’ll probably notice a few strange things about the chatbot’s presentation, and you’re meant to. OpenAI says its new voice functionality — it had one before, but it was essentially voice-to-text and text-to-voice features built on top of a chatbot — is responsive enough that it can be interrupted. It can also interpret and express a range of “emotive styles,” meaning that, as with text-based chatbots, ChatGPT will now attempt to assess and choose appropriate spoken tones. The company staged a live demonstration where a parade of nervous, camera-shy executives spoke to the chatbot, which responded with — at least at first listen — substantially more confidence than its human interlocutors had. It was alternately impressive and strange — here it is singing “Happy Birthday” after seeing a piece of cake with a candle in it:', 'OpenAI is showing off something technologically new here, and we can assume we’ll see similar demos from its competitors, possibly as soon as this week and perhaps from Google. The release also suggests, at minimum, an upgrade to the style of voice assistant currently epitomized by Siri and Alexa, which had promised big things before being demoted to kitchen timers and light switches. It’s also obviously evocative of representations of AI in science fiction, such as the movie Her, in which the lead character falls in love with a piece of software. This thing flatters, giggles, and does voices. It doesn’t exactly respond to being cut off as a person would, but it doesn’t just keep going or drop the conversation. It will perform whatever tone you ask it to but appears to default to an energetic, positive, supportive persona — a helpful co-worker, someone trying to be your friend, or, if you’re feeling suspicious, someone trying to get something from you.', 'Months of speculation about a new core model from OpenAI and endless hints at the possibility of “artificial general intelligence” from its executives and boosters have set incredibly high expectations for the company’s forthcoming products. What OpenAI presented was instead primarily a step forward in its products’ ability to perform the part of an intelligent machine. There are risks to doubling down on the personification of AI — if people are made to feel as though they’re talking to a person, their expectations will be both impossibly diverse and very high — but there are benefits, too, which OpenAI knows well.', 'ChatGPT was initially released as a public tech demo; it went viral because of its capabilities but also because it spoke more convincingly and freely than chatbots had before it. It wrote with confidence in a tone that suggested it was eager to help. It was highly responsive to requests even when it couldn’t fulfill them, though it would often try to anyway. There was (and remains) an enormous gap between what the interface suggested (that you were talking to a real person) and what you were actually doing (prompting a machine). With user expectations where they were, this interplay turned out to be hugely powerful. ChatGPT’s persona invited users to make generous assumptions about the underlying technology and, just as important, about where it would, or at least could, one day go.', 'Such personification is by definition misleading; whether you think that’s a problem depends a bit on what you think OpenAI and other AI firms are up to and how much potential their projects have. The optimistic outlook is that voice, like chat, is simply a specific, unusually natural interface for computers and that the better the illusion is, the easier it will be to tap into the full productive potential of AI. But OpenAI’s sudden emphasis on ChatGPT’s performance over, well, its performance is worth thinking about in critical terms, too. The new voice features aren’t widely available yet, but what the company showed off was powerfully strange: a chatbot that laughs at its own jokes, uses filler words, and is unapologetically ingratiating. To borrow Altman’s language, the fact that Monday’s demo “feels like magic” could be read as a warning or an admission: ChatGPT is now better than ever at pretending it’s something that it’s not.']"

Find him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)', 'OpenAI has launched its new flagship model, GPT-4o, which seamlessly integrates text, audio, and visual inputs and outputs, promising to enhance the naturalness of machine interactions.', 'GPT-4o, where the “o” stands for “omni,” is designed to cater to a broader spectrum of input and output modalities. “It accepts as input any combination of text, audio, and image and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs,” OpenAI announced.', 'Users can expect a response time as quick as 232 milliseconds, mirroring human conversational speed, with an impressive average response time of 320 milliseconds.', 'The introduction of GPT-4o marks a leap from its predecessors by processing all inputs and outputs through a single neural network. This approach enables the model to retain critical information and context that were previously lost in the separate model pipeline used in earlier versions.', 'Prior to GPT-4o, ‘Voice Mode’ could handle audio interactions with latencies of 2.8 seconds for GPT-3.5 and 5.4 seconds for GPT-4. The previous setup involved three distinct models: one for transcribing audio to text, another for textual responses, and a third for converting text back to audio. This segmentation led to loss of nuances such as tone, multiple speakers, and background noise.', 'As an integrated solution, GPT-4o boasts notable improvements in vision and audio understanding. It can perform more complex tasks such as harmonising songs, providing real-time translations, and even generating outputs with expressive elements like laughter and singing. Examples of its broad capabilities include preparing for interviews, translating languages on the fly, and generating customer service responses.', 'Nathaniel Whittemore, Founder and CEO of Superintelligent, commented: “Product announcements are going to inherently be more divisive than technology announcements because it’s harder to tell if a product is going to be truly different until you actually interact with it. And especially when it comes to a different mode of human-computer interaction, there is even more room for diverse beliefs about how useful it’s going to be.', '“That said, the fact that there wasn’t a GPT-4.5 or GPT-5 announced is also distracting people from the technological advancement that this is a natively multimodal model. It’s not a text model with a voice or image addition; it is a multimodal token in, multimodal token out. This opens up a huge array of use cases that are going to take some time to filter into the consciousness.”', 'GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo performance levels in English text and coding tasks but outshines significantly in non-English languages, making it a more inclusive and versatile model. It sets a new benchmark in reasoning with a high score of 88.7% on 0-shot COT MMLU (general knowledge questions) and 87.2% on the 5-shot no-CoT MMLU.', 'The model also excels in audio and translation benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models like Whisper-v3. In multilingual and vision evaluations, it demonstrates superior performance, enhancing OpenAI’s multilingual, audio, and vision capabilities.', 'OpenAI has incorporated robust safety measures into GPT-4o by design, incorporating techniques to filter training data and refining behaviour through post-training safeguards. The model has been assessed through a Preparedness Framework and complies with OpenAI’s voluntary commitments. Evaluations in areas like cybersecurity, persuasion, and model autonomy indicate that GPT-4o does not exceed a ‘Medium’ risk level across any category.', 'Further safety assessments involved extensive external red teaming with over 70 experts in various domains, including social psychology, bias, fairness, and misinformation. This comprehensive scrutiny aims to mitigate risks introduced by the new modalities of GPT-4o.', 'Starting today, GPT-4o’s text and image capabilities are available in ChatGPT—including a free tier and extended features for Plus users. A new Voice Mode powered by GPT-4o will enter alpha testing within ChatGPT Plus in the coming weeks.', 'Developers can access GPT-4o through the API for text and vision tasks, benefiting from its doubled speed, halved price, and enhanced rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo.', 'OpenAI plans to expand GPT-4o’s audio and video functionalities to a select group of trusted partners via the API, with broader rollout expected in the near future. This phased release strategy aims to ensure thorough safety and usability testing before making the full range of capabilities publicly available.', '“It’s hugely significant that they’ve made this model available for free to everyone, as well as making the API 50% cheaper.

The upgraded ChatGPT can swiftly respond to text, audio and video inputs from its real-time conversational partner – all while speaking with inflections and wording that convey a strong sense of emotion and personality.', 'The company demonstrated the emotional mimicry of the new voice mode during a supposedly live OpenAI presentation, featuring both the ChatGPT mobile app and a new desktop app, on 13 May. Speaking in a female-sounding voice and responding to the name ChatGPT, the new AI’s conversational capabilities seemed more akin to the personable AI voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 science fiction film Her than to the more canned and robotic responses of typical voice assistant technologies.', ""How this moment for AI will change society forever (and how it won't)"", '“The new GPT-4o voice-to-voice interaction more closely parallels human-human interaction,” says Michelle Cohn at the University of California, Davis. “A big part of this is the short lag times… but an even bigger part is the level of emotional expressiveness the voice generates.”', 'During a conversation with company CTO Mira Murati and two other employees, the GPT-4o-powered ChatGPT advised OpenAI’s Mark Chen on his heavy and fast-paced breathing by saying “Whoa, slow down, you’re not a vacuum cleaner” and then suggesting a breathing exercise. The AI also visually examined a drawing by OpenAI’s Barret Zoph, which included words and a heart, by responding in gushing tones: “Aw, I see you wrote I love ChatGPT, that is so sweet of you.”', 'The new ChatGPT also verbally instructed its conversational partners on solving a simple linear equation, explained the function of computer code and interpreted a chart showing temperature lines peaking in the summer months. When prompted, the AI even retold a made-up bedtime story several times, switching between increasingly dramatic narrations and singing the ending.', 'Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.', 'The new voice mode will first become available for paid subscribers of ChatGPT Plus in the coming weeks, said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a post on the platform X.', 'ChatGPT was able to recover conversationally even from the occasional technical glitch. When asked to interpret the facial expressions and emotions in a selfie of Zoph, the AI first suggested that it was looking at a wooden surface from a previous image before being prompted to evaluate the latest image.', '“Ahh, there we go – it looks like you’re feeling pretty happy and cheerful with a big smile and a touch of excitement,” said ChatGPT. “Whatever is going on, it looks like you’re in a good mood. Care to share the source of those good vibes?”', 'When told that it was because the live demo with ChatGPT was showcasing how “useful and amazing you are”, the AI responded: “Stop it, you’re making me blush.”', 'But Murati acknowledged that the updated version of ChatGPT powered by GPT-4o – which the company says will eventually be made available to even free ChatGPT users – comes with new safety risks because of how it incorporates and interprets real-time information. She said that OpenAI has been working on building in “mitigations against misuse”.', '“Having seamless multimodal conversations is really difficult, so the demos are impressive,” says Peter Henderson at Princeton University in New Jersey. “But as you add more modalities, safety becomes much more difficult and important – it will likely take some time to identify potential safety failure modes with such an expansion of inputs that the model makes use of.”', 'Henderson also described himself as “curious” to see OpenAI’s privacy terms once ChatGPT users start sharing input such as live audio and video, and whether free users can opt out of data collection that may be used to train future OpenAI models.', '“Since the model appears to be hosted off-device, the fact that you could be sharing your desktop screen with the model over the internet or continually recording audio or video seems to scale up the challenge for this particular product launch, if the plan is to store and use that data,” he says.', 'A more anthropomorphised AI chatbot also represents another threat: a bot that can fake empathy through voice conversations could potentially sound both more personable and persuasive to people, according to studies by Cohn and her colleagues. That raises the risk of people being more inclined to trust potentially inaccurate information and prejudiced stereotypes generated by such large language models.', '“This has important implications for how people both search and receive guidance from large language models, particularly as they do not always generate accurate information,” says Cohn.', 'Why choose the UK for commercial clinical trials?

The company claims that the new model will make ChatGPT smarter and easier to use.', 'Until now, OpenAI’s most advanced LLM was the GPT-4, which was only available to paid users. However, the GPT-4o will be freely available.', 'GPT-4o (“o” stands for “Omni” here) is being seen as a revolutionary AI model, which has been developed to enhance human-computer interactions. It lets users input any combination of text, audio, and image and receive responses in the same formats. This makes GPT-4o a multimodal AI model – a significant leap from previous models.', 'Describing the new model, OpenAI CTO Mira Murati said that it was the first time that OpenAI was making a huge step forward when it came to ease of use.', 'Based on the live demos, GPT-4o seems like ChatGPT transformed into a digital personal assistant that can assist users with a variety of tasks. From real-time translations to reading a user’s face and having real-time spoken conversations, this new model is far ahead of its peers.', 'GPT-4o is capable of interacting using text and vision, meaning it can view screenshots, photos, documents, or charts uploaded by users and have conversations about them. OpenAI said that the new updated version of ChatGPT will also have updated memory capabilities and will learn from previous conversations with users.', 'LLMs are the backbone of AI chatbots. Large amounts of data are fed into these models to make them capable of learning things themselves.', 'Unlike its predecessors that required multiple models to handle different tasks, GPT-4o uses a single model trained end-to-end across various modalities – text, vision, and audio. To illustrate this, Murati explained the voice mode on previous models, which was a combination of three different models – transcription, intelligence, and text-to-speech. With GPT-4o, all of this happens natively.', 'Essentially, this means the GPT-4o comes with an integration that allows it to process and understand inputs more holistically. For example, GPT-4o can understand tone, background noises, and emotional context in audio inputs at once. These abilities were a big challenge for earlier models.', 'When it comes to features and abilities, GPT-4o excels in areas like speed and efficiency as it responds to queries as fast as a human does in conversation, in around 232 to 320 milliseconds. This is a big leap over previous models, which came with response times of up to several seconds.', 'It comes with multilingual support, and shows significant improvements in handling non-English text, making it more accessible to a global audience.', 'The GPT-4o also features enhanced audio and vision understanding. During the demo session at the live event, ChatGPT solved a linear equation in real-time when the user was writing it on paper. It could gauge the emotions of the speaker on camera and identify objects.', 'Why does it matter?', 'It comes at a time when the AI race is intensifying, with tech giants Meta and Google working towards building more powerful LLMs and bringing them to various products. GPT-4o could be beneficial for Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI, as it can now embed the model in its existing services.', 'The new model also came a day ahead of the Google I/O developer conference, where Google is expected to announce new updates to its Gemini AI model. Similar to GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini is also expected to be multimodal. Further, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June, announcements on incorporating AI in iPhones or iOS updates are expected.', 'GPT-4o will be made available to the public in stages. Text and image capabilities are already rolling out on ChatGPT, with some services available to free users. Audio and video functionalities will come gradually to developers and selected partners, ensuring that each modality (voice, text-to-speech, vision) meets the necessary safety standards before full release.', 'Although it is claimed to be the most advanced model, GPT-4o is not without limitations. On its official blog, OpenAI said that GPT-4o is still in the early stages of exploring the potential of unified multimodal interaction, meaning certain features like audio outputs are initially accessible in a limited form only, with preset voices.', 'The company said that further development and updates are necessary to fully realise its potential in handling complex multimodal tasks seamlessly.', 'When it comes to safety, OpenAI said that GPT-4o comes with built-in safety measures, including “filtered training data, and refined model behaviour post training”. The company claimed that the new model has undergone extensive safety evaluations and external reviews, focussing on risks like cybersecurity, misinformation, and bias.', 'As of now, while GPT-4o scores only a Medium-level risk across these areas, OpenAI said that continuous efforts are in place to identify and mitigate emerging risks.', ""Bijin Jose, an Assistant Editor at Indian Express Online in New Delhi, is a technology journalist with a portfolio spanning various prestigious publications.

The most significant update is the ability for users to talk in real-time with ChatGPT — it can respond in 320 milliseconds on average, OpenAI said, which makes for more natural interactions.', 'Users can also show it live video through the ChatGPT app, or via a screen-sharing function using the desktop app.', 'OpenAI also upgraded the model’s ability to communicate in non-English languages; during a live demo, the chatbot acted as a real-time English-to-Italian translator.', 'The new version will be available to all ChatGPT users, but paid subscribers will have higher message limits.', 'OpenAI is at the fore of AI development, but the new model signals the company’s push to stay on top. Voice recognition and response is an especially competitive sector: OpenAI’s competitor, Google, is holding an event Tuesday in which it could announce a new virtual voice assistant, while Apple is expected to debut a more conversational, AI-powered version of Siri in June.', 'Insights from the Atlantic Council, Just Security, and Carnegie Politika', 'US officials warned Tuesday that Washington could hit Georgian politicians with sanctions in response to a contentious “foreign agent law,” which passed in Georgia’s parliament after weeks of mass protests in Tbilisi and strong international condemnation.', '“If the law goes forward out of conformity with EU norms and there is undermining of democracy here and there is violence against peaceful protesters then we will see restrictions coming from the United States,” US assistant secretary of state James O’Brien told a press conference in Tbilisi, mentioning potential financial and travel restrictions on individuals.', 'He also said the US could reconsider the $390 million in assistance it plans to send to Georgia “if we are now regarded as an adversary and not a partner.”', 'If enacted, the bill would require advocacy organizations, NGOs, and media outlets that receive more than 20% of funding from overseas to register as “pursuing the interests of a foreign power.” Critics say the Russian-style law could be used to muffle critical voices.', 'After passing through parliament on Tuesday, the bill now goes to Georgia’s president, who has vowed to veto it. But Georgia’s parliament — where the bill passed 84-30 — can override that veto with a simple majority. The ruling Georgian Dream politicians have said they expect the bill to be law by the end of May.', 'Few countries have expressed so strong a desire to join the EU as Georgia, which has enshrined its goal to join Europe and NATO in its constitution. For Georgia’s strongly pro-Europe youth, EU membership has come to represent a new political direction embracing equality, human rights, and shedding the country’s post-Soviet identity, one political scientist wrote for Carnegie’s blog Strategic Europe. But European officials have said the planned legislation could scupper Georgia’s EU candidacy, arguing that its restrictions on civil society are incompatible with European values. While Georgian Dream continues to say it aims to take the country into Europe, protesters believe the party is “carrying out orders from the Kremlin and see the law as a deliberate attempt to spoil Georgia’s bid to join Europe,” The Economist reported.', 'Experts argued the legislation moves Georgia further from Europe and deeper into Russia’s orbit. European officials have repeatedly warned the bill is not compatible with Georgia’s ambitions to join the EU; more than 80% of Georgians support membership. Yet Georgia’s ruling party, Georgian Dream, has gradually moved the country closer to Moscow, opting out of Western sanctions on Russia, supporting the relocation of Russian companies to Georgia, and resuming direct flights from Moscow to Tbilisi, one expert at the Atlantic Council wrote. With elections due in October, weakening an independent civil society and building ties with Russia may ultimately forge a path for Georgian Dream to retain power indefinitely, two former US officials wrote in Just Security.', 'Human rights groups have been united and clear in their strong opposition to the legislation. “They intend to marginalize and stifle critical voices in the country that are fundamental for any functioning democracy,” Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch said in a statement. While the bill’s supporters say it is modeled on the United States’ Foreign Agent Registration Act, the US law is designed to regulate lobbyists and does not suggest any group that receives foreign funding is under the control of a foreign state, Human Rights Watch noted. “All similar initiatives in the post-Soviet space — first in Russia, and then in Kyrgyzstan — have only had a detrimental impact on rights and freedoms,” an expert wrote in Carnegie Politika.', 'In his second day of testimony at Donald Trump’s criminal trial, former ally Michael Cohen said he committed several federal crimes to protect Trump, including lying to Congress “out of loyalty.” He also lied about the true nature of the hush-money payments at the center of the trial, he told the jury — that is, until he decided he could not lie any more, he said.', 'Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney and right-hand-man, also testified that the former president was directly involved in falsifying business records to reimburse him for a $130,000 payment — made to keep porn star Stormy Daniels quiet about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump and protect him ahead of the 2016 election.', 'Cohen’s testimony is vital to the prosecution’s allegations that Trump didn’t just falsify business records to conceal the payments, but did so as part of a broader conspiracy to get himself elected president in 2016.', 'Cohen, who will be the prosecution’s final witness, offers perhaps the most direct evidence to suggest Trump knew about the scheme and falsified the documents with that knowledge — the former president has repeatedly denied the allegations. The defense began a fiery cross-examination of Cohen on Tuesday, which will resume on Thursday.', 'As crucial as the disbarred attorney is to the prosecution, he is a star witness with a credibility problem. Prosecutors sought to get ahead of Trump’s defense cross-examination by airing Cohen’s dirty laundry themselves, but it’s a risky legal strategy.', 'Trump’s gag order stipulates he cannot make — or direct others to make — statements about the prosecutors, jury, witnesses, or judge’s family. But a parade of vice-presidential hopefuls and prominent Republicans — including House Speaker Mike Johnson — have beelined to Manhattan to act as his megaphone. Some court-watchers have pointed out that helping Trump seemingly skirt his gag order is “a dicey dance.” Asked Tuesday if he was “directing surrogates to speak on [his] behalf,” Trump told reporters he has “a lot of surrogates” who are “speaking beautifully.” But so long as Trump does not directly tell those ‘surrogates’ to sound off, “they can say whatever they want to say,” one former federal prosecutor said.', 'Trump’s inflammatory comments about the judges across his various ongoing trials are “inspiring widespread calls for violence,” a Reuters investigation has found. For example, after the former president railed against hush-money trial Judge Juan Merchan, who is not protected under the gag order, some Trump supporters called for Merchan’s execution on social media. Trump has not directly called for violence, but experts told Reuters that his language threatens the legitimacy of the independent judiciary. Anyone who crosses Trump can expect to face a barrage of threats, and two judges overseeing Trump’s other cases have recently been targeted in swatting incidents. That raises concerns that Trump’s verbal attacks are no longer “dog whistles” but “bullhorns” to his supporters, one expert told MSNBC.', 'Trump is bound to a New York courtroom several days a week, somewhat curtailing his campaign activity, while incumbent President Joe Biden can campaign all over the US as much as he pleases. But battleground-state polling hasn’t shifted much in Biden’s favor since Trump’s trial began, indicating that the former president’s legal woes have done little to boost Biden with undecided voters, many of whom say they’re most concerned with the cost of living, immigration, and Israel’s war in Gaza. It’s still possible that a Trump conviction could tip the scale: Polls suggest a fifth of Trump supporters would reconsider or withdraw support if he is convicted of a crime — enough to make a difference in what is expected to be a nail-biter election.', 'Sign up for Semafor Net Zero: The nexus of politics, tech, and energy. Read it now.', 'On Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced a hike in trade tariffs for $18 billion worth of Chinese goods — most notably green tech like electric vehicles and solar panels. The move is widely seen as an attempt to undercut Republican calls to limit Chinese goods stifling American competition, but it could also hurt Democrats’ promise of modernizing the country’s electricity grid.', 'Just on Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — an independent agency that oversees interstate energy transmission — introduced new rules that require grid managers and electricity providers to and plan 20 years ahead: Essentially requiring developers to upgrade their existing infrastructure or build new lines designed for renewable energy sources. And in a separate rule, the agency can now issue permits for new transmission lines, circumventing resistance from Republican states that don’t support the green energy transmission.', 'The new rules underscore a flashpoint in the energy policy debate between Republicans and Democrats, even as the US’ outdated energy infrastructure becomes increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity risks and general wear and tear.', 'Analysts said that the US commitment to green energy will only be delayed if the White House continues implementing protectionist trade policies on renewable energy.', 'The latest tariff hike on Chinese green tech effectively eliminates Chinese competition from the US market. The move could help Biden get support in Rust Belt states that could lead in manufacturing domestic green tech; but the tariffs also underscore “deep tensions” in Biden’s agenda between delivering well-paying jobs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to E&E news. While Chinese EVs are virtually non-existent on US roads, the new duties on solar panels may discourage consumers from buying panels, and keep them reliant on fossil fuels. They could also give domestic producers “less of an incentive to develop cheap goods in the long term” if they are shielded from foreign competition, according to The Economist. In contrast, Donald Trump has promised to hike tariffs on all foreign goods if elected that would hurt consumers even more if enacted.', 'When two Republican FERC members left their seats this year, Sen. Majority leader Chuck Schumer pounced at the opportunity and put pressure on the Democratic majority of the agency to enact the new transmission rules, the New York Times Times reported. Ultimately, the FERC is at the center of the energy policy tug-of-war between Democrats and Republicans — and particularly at the state level. Republicans want legislation to fast track permits for fossil fuel projects and pipelines. To that end, they have stalled legislation in Congress that would modernize the grid and help bring renewable energy online. Republicans are “against [transmission] just to be against Biden,” former FERC chair Neil Chatterjee told the Times.', 'The electrical grid is largely unable to reroute electricity quickly, which is a vital safety feature needed to accommodate fluctuating sources of renewable energy. But beyond hardware, the grid’s aging software makes it particularly susceptible to cyberattacks: The North American Electric Reliability Corporation last month estimated there are 60 new vulnerable points added to the grid every day, Reuters reported. These physical or digital weak spots are doors for hackers to inject malware and shut down portions of the grid, and cybersecurity experts are particularly concerned about Russia and China exploiting these vulnerabilities to cause massive blackouts across the country. Indeed, the Corporation said that the grid is particularly at risk as the US heads toward the upcoming election.', 'Insights from The Neuron, One Useful Thing, and The Verge', 'Sign up for Semafor Technology: What’s next in the new era of tech. Read it now.', 'On Monday, OpenAI led the pack with a new souped-up version of ChatGPT that can have real-time human-like conversations and chat in 50 languages. But the announcement was quickly followed by Google on Tuesday, which revealed it will integrate its flagship AI Gemini into Google Search and teased new voice and video chatbot features.', 'Meanwhile, Apple is racing to make upgrades to its AI assistant, Siri, to compete with its rivals’ latest offerings.', 'The flurry of updates follows the release of the buzzy — but criticized — Rabbit R1 personal assistant and the Humane AI pin. Ultimately the latest phase in the AI race could reshape how we find out new information online and language translation — and even change the phone in your pocket.', 'The latest integrations of AI into search engines and vice-versa moves the online ecosystem closer to a system where AI makes search engines obsolete. Google announced plans to effectively fuse search and AI, rolling out its AI-generated summaries, known as “AI Overviews,” will be available to everyone in the US this week. But creators and publishers are worried the changes will crater their web traffic, with traditional search links replaced by the summaries, The Washington Post reported. Research firm Gartner predicts search web traffic will fall 25 percent by 2026; a search consultant told the Post: “Some people are going to just get bludgeoned.”', 'OpenAI’s newest model, GPT-4o, can respond to a user’s voice prompts within an average of 320 milliseconds: “It’s uncannily human-like, perhaps too much so,” AI-focused newsletter The Neuron wrote. “But it means that for tasks you’d normally attempt with Siri, you should use ChatGPT instead.” The new features seem geared toward making AI more connected to human systems, which could give it more real-world application, AI scholar Ethan Mollick wrote. “This is where AI labs are leading us: to a near future of AI as coworker, friend, and ubiquitous presence.”', 'Tech companies are increasingly looking for ways to integrate AI into hardware. Fast Company wrote at the beginning of the year that 2024 would see AI “become an integral part of smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets.” Both the Humane AI Pin and Rabbit R1 received mostly negative reviews, with The Verge’s David Pierce predicting new ways to “interact with AI on your phone,” like high-tech headphones or smartwatches. Google and Apple could have a head start in that space, since they already make phones that have some level of AI integration. But ChatGPT’s app, with the new voice and video chat functions, could challenge their dominance.', 'Insights from Inkyfada, Foreign Policy, Deutsche Welle', 'Tunisian lawyers held a national strike on Tuesday to protest a police raid on the country’s bar association headquarters and the arrest of a high-profile lawyer known to be critical of the government.', 'Sonia Dahmani was arrested after taking refuge inside the bar’s association headquarters and detained on Saturday after she made sarcastic comments about Tunisia’s economic woes on television last week. Police also arrested two radio journalists for their comments on air as well as social media posts, according to their lawyers.', 'They are the latest among the dozens of lawyers and journalists who have been detained under Decree 54, a law introduced by Tunisia’s President Kaies Saied in 2022. The law was designed to combat cybercrime and misinformation, but it is increasingly being used to silence the president’s critics.', 'Saied was elected in 2019 in the country’s second presidential election after the pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings. But he shut down parliament and assumed authority over the judiciary in 2021, a move the opposition calls a coup.', 'The arrests also come as more Tunisians are taking to the street to demand Saied set a date for this year’s presidential elections, a delay that opposition party members have also criticized him for.', 'In an analysis of the Presidential Decree-Law 2022-54, known as Decree 54, Tunisian non-profit media collective Inkyfada described the law’s use as a “witch hunt.” The outlet reported more than twenty cases from 2023 in which journalists, lawyers, politicians, academics, and activists were detained for comments they posted online or made to the media. “No one is safe,” the president of the National Union of Tunisian Journalists said, “this type of surveillance is life threatening.” The International Commission of Jurists, an advocacy group based in Geneva, noted the law’s criminalization of “fake news” and “rumors” are overbroad and vague, constituting a “serious threat to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.”', 'Tunisia’s main opposition coalition in parliament, the National Salvation Front, announced a boycott of this year’s presidential elections, which have not yet been scheduled. “The Front rejects participation in any electoral charade due to the absence of conditions for fair and democratic elections,” coalition leaders said, and called for the release of political opponents and reinstatement of Tunisia’s judiciary. At least seven candidates — many jailed in Tunisia or exiled abroad — have said they will run, declarations that local outlet Tunigate said are designed to “embarrass President Kais Saied to remove the ambiguity of the election date.” Foreign Policy’s Allison Meakem said it’s difficult to gauge how many Tunisians support the president, as opposition boycotts of parliamentary elections made “the results almost comically lopsided.”', 'Located just 130 kilometers offshore of Italian islands like Lampedusa, the Tunisian city of Sfax is a hub for both Tunisians and Sub-Saharan migrants attempting to cross into Europe. President Saied has pushed for the deportation of migrants, authorized camp sweeps and activist arrests, while tensions have risen domestically as Tunisians increasingly compete with refugees and migrants for resources and jobs. The EU has a stake: The bloc signed a €105 million border management deal with Tunisia in 2023, a move that Amnesty International’s European director called “deeply immoral.” Meanwhile, one analyst from the European Council on Foreign Relations noted the deal is “designed to keep migrants and refugees out of the EU, not Tunisia itself.”', 'Insights from the South China Morning Post, The Sunday Times, and The Spectator', 'Sign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now.', 'Following several high-profile espionage arrests in recent weeks, the UK has summoned China’s ambassador — both to condemn the alleged behavior and warn that it risks deteriorating already fragile Sino-British relations.', 'The UK’s Foreign Office was “unequivocal in setting out that the recent pattern of behavior directed by China against the UK including cyber attacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable,” according to a statement.', 'UK officials have charged three people — including a former Hong Kong traffic cop who worked at the city’s Economic and Trade Office in London — for spying on Chinese dissidents in the UK. That’s significant because Hong Kong’s economic and trade policy has been left largely free of Chinese influence under its “one government, two systems” model — but the arrest suggests that freedom waning.', 'Meanwhile, British authorities have been ramping up counter-espionage operations targeting suspected Chinese spies — including a former Conservative parliamentary researcher — in recent weeks; Beijing has largely condemned and denied the accusations.', 'That a Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office official was arrested for espionage could spark questions about the independence of the city’s foreign trade offices, effectively shutting down the last branch of autonomy Hong Kong has over its external affairs, according to the South China Morning Post. While Hong Kong’s National Security Law means that Beijing now largely controls the city’s legislative and judicial systems, the city has been able to maintain some economic autonomy and organize its trade deals independently of Beijing. But the spying incidents will push China hawks in the UK and abroad to “demand authorities to review the relevant acts governing the operation of the trade offices in their countries,” one Hong Kong-based international relations academic said.', 'UK universities are a target of Chinese espionage, according to UK intelligence. Chinese researchers are recruited by Beijing “to steal technology” for military purposes, reported freelance journalist and frequent CNN commentator Latika Bourke. University staff could soon be required to have security clearance because it’s so pervasive, she added. In turn,Beijing funds hundreds of scholarships to send Chinese students to UK universities and monitor dissident activity on campus, according to a Scottish intelligence report. Several academics interviewed by the Sunday Times recalled Chinese students who questioned their political beliefs, with some staff alleging the students reported them to China’s embassy.', 'Beijing has historically relied on its huge diaspora worldwide for espionage, and Chinese spy agencies “used to be circumspect about recruiting foreigners and using techniques such as honey-traps,” former MI6 director Nigel Inkster wrote in The Spectator. But with more dissidents becoming vocal within the Chinese community abroad — and the West becoming more suspicious of China-born individuals — Beijing is increasingly relying on foreigners for espionage. Many of these Western agents are recruited while studying abroad or working in China. They are offered money “in exchange for something quite uncontroversial…but in due course, this progresses into more sensitive information requests,” Inskter wrote.', 'Insights from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, The Economist', 'US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Ukraine on a surprise visit Tuesday to offer reassurances of support as long-delayed American weaponry arrived in the country.', 'The trip comes as the Kremlin announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing this week, as the two nations strengthen their “no-limits” partnership. Beijing has operated as a lifeline for Moscow, which has been penalized for its invasion of Ukraine through widespread Western sanctions.', 'The US recently agreed a $61 billion aid package for Kyiv that includes air defense interceptors, artillery, and long-range ATACMS missiles.', 'Ukraine has been less successful at fending off Russian missile strikes in recent months, a New York Times analysis found. The Russian military has “improved its tactics, firing larger and more complex barrages,” the report said, and Ukraine’s shortage of reliable ammunition or defenses has meant that it can’t properly defend itself. Moscow has also upped its offensive on the country’s eastern front, targeting communities that faced the initial invasion in 2022. Residents are fleeing en masse from their homes, and believe that Russia is making a run at taking the city of Kharkiv, located just 25 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.', 'Russia’s economy has survived Western sanctions, and in a surprise cabinet reshuffle over the weekend Putin appointed an economist as the new defense minister — a move viewed as an attempt to emphasize the Kremlin’s focus on curbing runaway wartime spending. The US has repeatedly threatened to crack down on Beijing for sending supplies to Russia that could aid its war effort, but Xi seems to be strengthening his relationship with Putin. “Russia is fundamental to China’s grand strategy,” Manoj Kewalramani, head of Indo-Pacific studies at the Bangalore-based Takshashila Institution, told CNN. Xi may be trying to avoid escalating tensions with the West, but “there is a deep interest in making sure that Russia doesn’t lose the war,” he said.', 'China has closely watched the US impose sanctions against Russian banks following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Washington targeted the Russian elites’ dollar-based assets — a move that alarmed Beijing, which has sought to find ways of circumventing a similar financial crisis. Sanctions are being deployed by Western nations against nations or individuals, sparking “an unprecedented surge in financial warfare,” The Economist noted. As a result, nations are becoming adept at finding a way around sanctions. Western countries “must contend with the growing prosperity and financial sophistication of ‘third countries’ — ones that neither impose American and European sanctions, nor are under sanctions themselves,” the outlet added.']"

We sat down with Marshall, an Adobe Acrobat partner, to hear about how her content and business have evolved, as well as the role AI has played in helping her be her most productive.', 'Q: How did the Corporate Natalie persona come to be? ', 'A: Like many people, the culture of remote work the pandemic created made me reflect on this new (and, at the time, bizarre) way of working--video conference etiquette, the personas of different coworkers, and of course, balancing my work and personal life from the same spot in my house every day. I started to tap into these shared feelings about WFH and “Corporate Natalie” was born. ', 'There’s a lot of content out there now about corporate life these days, but it was only a few years ago when that kind of material was new, exciting, and risky. Looking back at many of the comments in my videos, I started to realize that I’m almost trauma-bonded with my followers based on my experiences working in that culture--the oversharing coworker, the boss who’s never at their desk, even bad Wi-Fi connections. It was comforting to see how many of my followers felt the same.', 'Q: How has your content and your business evolved (or stayed the same) since the pandemic’s early days? ', 'A: Once folks started returning to the office, so did Corporate Natalie. I then started to focus on pivoting my content to the changing times. These days, I’m creating more content about “just” Natalie, sans the “corporate.” For example, I’ve been posting more about my workouts and travels, and have even launched a new vlog series--“Day in My Silly Little Life”--with the same playful humor that my followers recognize. ', 'While my life--and by extension, my content--has changed quite a bit since the early days of the pandemic, what hasn’t changed is my hands-on approach when it comes to the business of content creation like brand partnerships. Ironically, this work keeps me close to the corporate world, giving me new inspiration for Corporate Natalie daily.', 'Q: You mentioned the “business of content creation.” What role does Document AI play in helping you manage everything associated with running a business and creating content? ', 'A: I recently had an opportunity to partner with Adobe on creating content for the new Adobe Acrobat AI Assistant. We don’t use a traditional talent agency to handle logistics of Corporate Natalie brand deals, so throughout that work with Adobe, I started to realize how AI can help me and my brand manager, Annie, handle the front- and back-end business of content creation.', 'Q: In what ways? ', 'A: Most of the important documents we review daily are in PDF, and reviewing contracts and dense creative briefs can take up a lot of time. It’s easy to miss things when you’re given a 45-page document to read, review, and redline. Acrobat AI Assistant helps me go in, ask questions, and make sure we’re hitting all the sections that matter to us. It’s been an absolute time saver! The generative summary capability in Acrobat AI Assistant also creates short, easy-to-read overviews of the content inside these long and complex briefs. ', 'Also, as soon as I started running this business, I quickly realized that I had to let go of certain administrative tasks to free up creative time. It was during an Intro to Accounting class in my undergraduate business school when I had the epiphany that I never want to be an accountant, so the first thing I did when I started this business was outsource accounting to an actual CPA. When it comes to collaborating with my partners and potential partners, I lean on AI to consolidate and format information into top takeaways, text for emails, presentations, and reports. AI has also been helpful for summarizing my podcast episodes to generate episode summaries.', 'Q: Have there been any unexpected ways that AI has helped you? ', ""A: Interestingly, it’s helped me find inspiration for creating new videos. Corporate culture I know. But Gen Z culture? That’s a little trickier. We’ll occasionally use AI to help with developing a script that we're working on, or if we’re doing [a video about] a certain type of person. AI can also help us grab insights and provide short overviews from long research documents about Gen Z trends. While AI doesn’t fully understand my humor (yet), it’s a great jumping off point. "", 'Q: As a content creator, where would you like to see AI head next? ', 'A: AI has been a buzz category for a while now, but I think we’re still scratching the surface of how it can help us be our most productive. While it’s still early days, I can already see how AI provides tremendous value for me--not just now, but also tomorrow.', 'To follow Corporate Natalie’s humorous adventures juggling work and life, check out her Instagram page.

Or will it represent a larger shift in how OpenAI does business? OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment."", 'Newton-Rex is also curious to know if OpenAI will allow other companies to use its Media Manager so that artists can signal their preferences to multiple AI developers at once. “If not, it will just add further complexity to an already complex opt-out environment,” says Newton-Rex, who was formerly an executive at Stability AI, developer of the Stable Diffusion image generator.', 'OpenAI is not the first to look for ways for artists and other content creators to signal their preferences about use of their work and personal data for AI projects. Other tech companies, from Adobe to Tumblr, also offer opt-out tools regarding data collection and machine learning. The startup Spawning launched a registry called Do Not Train nearly two years ago and creators have already added their preferences for 1.5 billion works.', ""Jordan Meyer, CEO of Spawning, says the company is not working with OpenAI on its Media Manager project, but is open to doing so. “If OpenAI is able to make registering or respecting universal opt-outs easier, we'll happily incorporate their work into our suite,” he says."", 'MATT SIMON', 'Like Newton-Rex, though, Meyer worries that the creation of many different opt-in systems will be too onerous for artists and creators. “A proliferation of disparate opt-out tools built by AI giants is exactly what we need to avoid,” he says. “Opting out should be simple and universal, which we believe requires an open system built by a third party.”', 'Past attempts by major AI developers to provide people more control over how their data is used haven’t always run smoothly. Last year, Meta launched a way for people who didn’t want their personal data used to train Meta’s AI to request it be deleted. Many artists interpreted this as way to ask for their work to be opted-out of Meta’s AI projects, and were frustrated when the company declined to process their requests. (Meta, for its part, told WIRED that it was not an opt-out feature.)', ""Meanwhile, a rising movement that objects to AI’s approach to training data is advocating for a far more radical change: Switching to a regime where AI companies only train algorithms on data with explicit permission from creative and rights holders. “When it comes to companies that are looking to turn massive profits and to disrupt industries, I don't think opt-out works at all,” says concept artist and illustrator Reid Southen, who often writes about AI and art. “Opt-in is the only feasible way forward.”"", 'Southen and Newton-Rex both say that opt-out tools can put an undue burden on creatives, especially if these tools require them to submit requests for each individual work they want to exclude from training. “Imagine if you’re a photographer with thousands and thousands of images,” Southern says. “There’s no way.”', 'Navigate election season with our WIRED Politics Lab newsletter and podcast', 'A hacker took down North Korea’s internet.

The other, a sleek modern mansion in San Francisco’s Twin Peaks neighborhood, was started by former Google Brain researcher Jeremy Nixon. Their patrons include a trick-or-treat bag of tech personalities — billionaire Google cofounder Sergey Brin, musician and AI evangelist Grimes and some of Sand Hill Road’s most coveted investors. But in dueling trademark applications, the estranged proprietors of the first house both claim ownership of the AGI House brand, telling Forbes they’re willing to go to court for it.', 'The balkanization of AGI House was the culmination of tensions that had been escalating since Yu moved into the Hillsborough property in December 2022. Nixon claims he brought Yu on in an operational role; Yu said he always believed he’d be taking over the house and that Nixon’s claims to it have been dramatically overstated. “He’s trying to say he did a lot of work and contributed a lot of things, but among the nine residents in the house, probably he did the least,” Yu told Forbes. “I wouldn’t say bad things about him, but he was definitely not a top performer in the house.”', 'Nixon called Yu’s position “farcical” and “deeply disrespectful.” “Had I not existed, what would’ve happened in the world?” he said. “The shadow of my influence stands over everything that is done in the Hillsborough house. If Rocky never existed, AGI House would still exist. He should thank me for creating everything that he currently is standing on top of.”', 'So now there are two AGI Houses, in two very different locales, with two competing visions. Nixon dreams of an “intellectual community” without a formalized business structure, a nod to an earlier time of communes and revolutionary salons. But in Yu’s eyes, the community is a business. He wants to platform and invest in the AI startups that emerge from it. He established AGI House Ventures, and said he’s already secured half of the capital he needs from limited partners like Android creator Rich Miner.

Worse news: Delta’s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week.', 'As of 2pm ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 466 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 28 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday between Delta and Delta connection.', 'There were more than 1,000 Delta and Delta Connection listed as delayed by FlightAware. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. No other US airline had canceled one tenth as many flights.', 'The problems prompted the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to announce the Department of Transportation would be starting an investigation to make sure Delta is following the law and treating passengers fairly.', 'The DOT said it has received a “high volume of consumer complaints” about Delta’s actions since Friday. The department said if can penalize an airline for “an unfair and deceptive practice” if it finds finds that an airline provided inadequate customer assistance when flights are canceled or travel plans significantly changed.', 'Buttigieg asked passengers with complaints to contact the Department of Transportation.', '“While you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,” he tweeted. “We will follow up.”', 'Delta said it cooperating with the investigation.', 'RELATED ARTICLE\nWhat Delta passengers are entitled to in terms of compensation', '“We remain entirely focused on restoring our operation,” the company told CNN in a statement. “Across our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.”', 'The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday.', 'Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes.', 'The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company’s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday.', '“So we’re optimistic we’ll get it done,” Samant said in the video message along with CEO Ed Bastian. “There will be some things as Ed said, that we will do today, tomorrow to get to a better place by the end of the week.” He said the IT staff is working “feverishly” and “around the clock” to fix the problem.', 'The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight.', 'Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members also are unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don’t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available.', 'Jeremy and Kaylee Jones were married on Saturday and left Spokane, Washington Monday for their honeymoon, they told CNN. Five guests weren’t able to attend the wedding due to flight issues.', 'They arrived in Atlanta early Tuesday morning for a connecting flight from Atlanta to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. There were no issues with the flights until they landed in Atlanta this morning and saw the flight to St. Lucia was cancelled due to a lack of crew. The next Delta flight to St. Lucia is not until Friday, so they are canceling their honeymoon.', 'The only other option is to be re-routed to other airports, which they believe will have the same problem, and they still don’t have their luggage.', '“Currently I’m pretty sour,” Jeremy Jones said. “I get that things happen. This is just shocking to me that a multi-billion dollar corporation would struggle this much to get the ball rolling again.”', '“I’m thinking the domino effect of flight cancellations are causing people to be stuck here for 5 days. I have no confidence in getting anywhere at this point.”', 'This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company’s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: “Please enter below what airport code you are closest to,” “What is your current status?” and “Please describe your current location.”', 'A person familiar with the airline’s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews.', 'To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members.', 'The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James.', 'That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses.', 'Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair.', 'After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the fourth quarter of that year and the first two months of 2023. In addition to customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation.', 'Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers.', 'Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that.', 'United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline’s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them.', 'At Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta’s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage are lined up on the floors of baggage claim. The bags made it to the world’s busiest airport but, through delays and cancellations, their owners either have not yet arrived or arrived on a different plane.', 'Delta employees from all different departments and roles across the company were supplementing efforts to help passengers who made it to Hartsfield to find their bags.', 'Arthur Ginolfi, who had flown into Atlanta for a Global Business Travel Association convention after two trips to the airport in Philadelphia over the weekend, was one of those picking up a bag that had arrived on a different flight than he did.', '“This is the worst experience I’ve ever had in my 35 years of business travel,” he said. “There are lines that were unacceptable, there were people that were frustrated. I saw and I heard a lot of sad stories.”', 'He said he thinks Delta needs to be offering more compensation than he’s gotten from the airline so far.', '“I had to pay for parking for 12 hours, I had to pay for food, I had to pay for tolls,” he said. “I deserve more pros than a $24 gift card.”', 'This story has been updated with additional context and developments.', 'CNN’s Isabel Rosales contributed to this report.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation.', 'Delta’s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled.

The goal is to eat real food that’s not ultra-processed, and that’s not going to happen if you don’t have a grocery store near you.', 'We looked at the number of grocery stores per capita in each city. Here’s what we discovered when looking at the best and worst locales in this specific category.', 'Most grocery stores per 100,000 residents', 'Fewest grocery stores per 100,000 residents', 'You may expect to see large metropolitan statistical areas, or MSA, like New York and Boston with a high prevalence of grocery stores. But New Orleans is more surprising since food insecurity impacts an estimated 15% of the population. Its neighbor Metairie may play a role in boosting its ranking. ', 'According to the CDC, the recommended amount of sleep each night is at least seven hours. Quality sleep reduces the risk of a variety of diseases and contributes to weight loss. What’s even better is that getting the right amount of sleep can be an easy win for better health.', 'The CDC tracks the percentage of adults getting less than seven hours of sleep. So we’ve ranked the best cities for sleep as having the lowest percentage of adults sleeping less than the minimum recommended amount.

You don’t need expensive equipment or a gym membership to get outside and walk. But some cities are better suited for daily walking than others.

', 'Most walkable cities in the U.S.', 'Least walkable cities in the U.S.', 'Larger cities like Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia have plenty of pavement to hit each day. You may be harder pressed to walk out of your office or apartment in more sprawling cities like Virginia Beach, Columbus and Houston. ', 'Your mental health is just as important as your physical health; and in reality, the two are inextricably linked. Most people eat to combat stress. By addressing mental health issues, like anxiety or depression, you may be able to decrease the habit of eating for mood elevation.', 'Cities with larger concentrations of psychologists and psychiatrists make it easier to find a mental health professional you like and get on their schedule in a timely manner.', 'From avoiding stress eating to managing anxiety, accessing mental health care can be just as important when it comes to healthy living as finding the right doctor for your physical needs.

', 'Nutrition: Increasing your servings of fruits and vegetables is a great way to boost your vitamin and mineral intake. They’re also a major source of fiber; research reveals that fiber intake lowers the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Upping your protein is another way to keep you energized and satiated while working on your health. ', 'Behavior: Building healthy habits helps you both physically and mentally. In addition to eating nutritious foods, find ways to get active, increase your mental stimulation, and socialize. Making healthy lifestyle choices can have a big impact on longevity. The World Economic Forum attributes 70% of global deaths to four behaviors: physical inactivity, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking.', 'Movement: Being active on a regular basis is an important part of any weight loss plan. Research indicates that consistent weekly exercise improves the odds of keeping those extra pounds off. If you have trouble staying motivated, consider finding an accountability partner who can help you stay consistent. ', 'Also look for realistic options for your schedule and where you live. In sprawling areas that are less walkable, you may need to use a treadmill or stationary bike. But that doesn’t have to be prohibitively expensive. You can find relatively inexpensive gyms that charge just $10 to $20 per month to use their basic equipment.', 'Not only does regular movement help make you healthier, it could also help improve the quality of your sleep—another foundational component of healthy living. ', 'Medical treatment: In some cases, your doctor may recommend prescription medication to help with weight loss. According to the FDA, GLP-1 medications like Ozempic or compounded semaglutide can be effective in regulating appetite and blood sugar levels. When paired with other healthy behaviors, like movement and nutrition, you can take a multi-pronged approach to healthier living. ', 'Location is only one part of healthy living. Ultimately, it’s individual behaviors executed on a daily basis that have the most impact on getting and staying healthy. The best part is that you don’t have to do it alone.

However, exercise levels, mental health concerns, and overall lack of sleep may be hampering physical health.', ""On July 23, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the Elevance Health Foundation published the 17th annual ACSM American Fitness Index, ranking how well 100 of America's largest cities support healthy, active lifestyles."", ""The Index focuses on three primary areas associated with overall health and well being — the city's design for physical activity and active transportation, healthy food access initiatives, and community mental health services."", 'According to research, communities designed to provide optimal walking and biking access, and those with parks close to where people live, can help residents achieve better health and wellness.', 'In addition, cities with policies that enhance access to mental health services can help residents address conditions such as depression, which could impact physical well-being.', 'The Index results are based on 33 evidence-based indicators. ACSM President Stella Volpe, Ph.D., FACSM, ACSM-CEP, tells Healthnews that the indicators were initially selected by ACSM content experts and other nationally recognized fitness experts who understood the importance of community assets in improving health behaviors and outcomes. The analysts gathered city health indicator values from reputable, regularly updated, publicly available data sources.', 'The indicator values for the cities were ranked, weighted, and combined into a personal health subscore, a community/environment subscore, and a total score. The analysts used these scores to rank cities from the most fit (rank 1) to the least fit (rank 100).', 'Overall, Fitness Index findings showed that more people in the United States are walking and biking to work, spending more money at parks, and experiencing slightly improved food security.', 'However, the 100-city analysis also found that many Americans are not getting enough exercise to meet ACSM standards. These standards recommend that people get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus two days of muscle-strengthening activity per week.', 'In addition, Index results found that fewer individuals sleep seven or more hours per night, and fewer people reported they are in excellent/very good health. The analysis also showed an increase in residents reporting poor physical and mental wellbeing.', '""There are a number of reasons why people are not getting enough sleep, exercising enough, and reporting poorer mental and physical health,"" Volpe tells Healthnews. ""For example, some people may be working a number of jobs and do not have time in their day. Some people may not have access, either financial or physical access (that is, the built environment in their city is not conducive for promoting physical activity), and for some people, it is that they do not enjoy being active.""', '""Movement is walking, gardening, dancing, seated exercises, etc. The accumulation of minutes of physical activity per day is as effective as exercising/being physically active at one time,"" Volpe explains.', 'Moreover, people with sedentary jobs should try to get up and move every 30 minutes or every hour, as prolonged sitting may increase the risk of diabetes and obesity.', 'According to Volpe, lack of sleep and poor mental and physical health are also connected.', '""If people are not getting the proper amount of sleep per night (8 to 9 hours for adults), their risk for diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and obesity increases,"" Volpe says. ""In addition, being physically active has been shown to stave off chronic disease and can help with mental health.""', 'According to the Fitness Index findings, Arlington, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, Washington, were the top three fittest cities.', 'Arlington clinched the number-one spot for several reasons. The city ranked high in community/environmental indicators and had the highest rate of residents exercising in the previous month (87.8%). Data also showed that Arlington had the highest number of residents getting seven or more hours of sleep a night (76.4%) and the lowest smoking rates (3.4%).', 'People living in Washington, D.C., had the highest rate of consuming two or more fruits a day (37.9%) and came in second at consuming three or more vegetables per day (21.4%). Moreover, Washington, D.C., was one of the top five cities for exercising in the previous month, walking or biking to work, and using public transportation.', 'In addition to having the third-highest rate of exercise in the previous month, Seattle, Washington, also had the third-highest park expenditures, at $321 per person.', 'Other top-ranking fit cities were:', 'The top 10 lowest-ranked cities include:', ""While Lexington, Kentucky's rankings jumped up 31 slots and Miami, Florida's rankings improved 26 places to land at the number 13 position, two other cities experienced significant drops in their Fitness Index rankings."", ""For example, Tampa, Florida, fell 21 slots to the 45th position. While the city's community/environmental indicators remained relatively stable, personal health indicators involving sleep duration and perceived health status decreased. A rise in reports of poor physical health and an uptick in obesity, asthma, stroke, diabetes, and pedestrian fatality rates also contributed to Tampa's lower ranking."", 'Moreover, Greensboro, North Carolina, dropped 18 places, landing at number 80 on the Index, likely due to fewer residents reporting seven or more hours of sleep and excellent/very good health. Index results also showed an increase in reports of poor mental well being.', 'Still, the ACSM notes that the biggest reason for a drop in ranking is that some cities scored slightly higher, bumping others down the list.', 'Volpe says that while all health indicators are important, those that focus on helping people be more active, such as city designs that allow for better access to physical activity, are most critical.', '""If people move more, that leads to better personal health indicators, so they all really are intertwined,"" Volpe explains.', 'Moreover, Fitness Index rankings can provide cities with a roadmap of their strengths and highlight areas that need improvement to boost the health of their citizens.', 'Volpe concludes, ""It is not an easy task, and cities need resources to do so, but starting with small changes can go a long way in helping people be more active and lead to improved quality of life.""', 'Your email will not be published.

Arlington ranked first overall and in community/environmental factors and fourth for personal health behind Seattle, D.C. and San Francisco, respectively.', 'Because ACSM gives the community factors a little more weight than the personal health ones, Arlington claimed the top spot, says ACSM President Stella Volpe.', '“If the city has park systems that are available to people and they’re easy to access, if they have easy-access bike paths or walking paths, they have easy access for people to get public transportation and/or walk to their place of work, those things are going to rank higher,” Volpe says. “Not that we don’t care about the personal health rank, but…we want to see what those cities are doing.”', 'In the personal health category, Arlington had the highest number of residents who reported exercising in the previous month (87.8%) and getting at least seven hours of sleep per night (76.4%), and the lowest amount who smoked (3.4%).', 'One reason why Arlington has earned the top spot since 2017 is consistency, Volpe says. “Part of it is they have the resources,” she says of the county. “Part of it is that they’re keeping it maintained, and the other part of it is—it’s become the DNA of people who live there.

We've updated this blog to note the news."", 'The latest update of Privacy Badger opts users out of ad tracking through Google’s “Privacy Sandbox.” ', 'Privacy Sandbox is Google’s way of letting advertisers keep targeting ads based on your online behavior without using third-party cookies. Third-party cookies were once the most common form of online tracking technology, but major browsers, like Safari and Firefox, started blocking them several years ago. After pledging to eventually do the same for Chrome in 2020, and after several delays, today Google backtracked on its privacy promise, announcing that third-party cookies are here to stay. Notably, Google Chrome continues to lag behind other browsers in terms of default protections against online tracking.', ""Privacy Sandbox might be less invasive than third-party cookies, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for your privacy. Instead of eliminating online tracking, Privacy Sandbox simply shifts control of online tracking from third-party trackers to Google. With Privacy Sandbox, tracking will be done by your Chrome browser itself, which shares insights gleaned from your browsing habits with different websites and advertisers. Despite sounding like a feature that protects your privacy, Privacy Sandbox ultimately protects Google's advertising business."", 'How did Google get users to go along with this? In 2023, Chrome users received a pop-up about “Enhanced ad privacy in Chrome.” In the U.S., if you clicked the “Got it” button to make the pop-up go away, Privacy Sandbox remained enabled for you by default. Users could opt out by changing three settings in Chrome. But first, they had to realize that ""Enhanced ad privacy"" actually enabled a new form of ad tracking.', ""You shouldn't have to read between the lines of Google’s privacy-washing language to protect your privacy. Privacy Badger will do this for you!"", 'If you use Google Chrome, Privacy Badger will update three different settings that constitute Privacy Sandbox:', 'Ad topics: This setting allows Google to generate a list of topics you’re interested in based on the websites you visit. Any site you visit can ask Chrome what topics you’re supposedly into, then display an ad accordingly. Some of the potential topics–like “Student Loans & College Financing”, “Credit Reporting & Monitoring”, and “Unwanted Body & Facial Hair Removal”–could serve as proxies for sensitive financial or health information, potentially enabling predatory ad targeting. In an attempt to prevent advertisers from identifying you, your topics roll over each week and Chrome includes a random topic 5% of the time. However, researchers found that Privacy Sandbox topics could be used to re-identify users across websites. Using 1,207 people’s real browsing histories, researchers showed that as few as three observations of a person’s “ad topics” was enough to identify 60% of users across different websites.', 'Site-suggested ads: This setting enables ""remarketing"" or ""retargeting,"" which is the reason you’re constantly seeing ads for things you just shopped for online. It works by allowing any site you visit to give information (like “this person loves sofas”) to your Chrome browser. Then when you visit a site that runs ads, Chrome uses that information to help the site display a sofa ad without the site learning that you love sofas. However, researchers demonstrated this feature of Privacy Sandbox could be exploited to re-identify and track users across websites, partially infer a user’s browsing history, and manipulate the ads that other sites show a user.', ""Ad measurement: This setting allows advertisers to track ad performance by storing data in your browser that's then shared with the advertised sites. For example, after you see an ad for shoes, whenever you visit that shoe site it’ll get information about the time of day the ad was shown and where the ad was displayed. Unfortunately, Google allows advertisers to include a unique ID with this data. So if you interact with multiple ads from the same advertiser around the web, this ID can help an advertiser build a profile of your browsing habits."", 'Privacy Badger is committed to protecting you from online tracking. Despite being billed as a privacy feature, Privacy Sandbox protects Google’s bottom line at the expense of your privacy. Nearly 80% of Google’s revenue comes from online advertising. By building ad tracking into your Chrome browser, Privacy Sandbox gives Google even more control of the advertising ecosystem than it already has. Yet again, Google is rewriting the rules for the internet in a way that benefits itself first.', 'Researchers and regulators have already found that Privacy Sandbox “fails to meet its own privacy goals.” In a draft report leaked to the Wall Street Journal, the UK’s privacy regulator noted that Privacy Sandbox could be exploited to identify anonymous users and that companies will likely use it to continue tracking users across sites. Likewise, after researchers told Google about 12 attacks they conducted on a key feature of Privacy Sandbox prior to its public release, Google forged ahead and released the feature after mitigating only one of those attacks.', 'Privacy Sandbox offers some privacy improvements over third-party cookies. But it reinforces Google’s commitment to behavioral advertising, something we’ve been advocating against for years. Behavioral advertising incentivizes online actors to collect as much of our information as possible. This can lead to a range of harms, like bad actors buying your sensitive information and predatory ads targeting vulnerable populations.', ""Your browser shouldn’t put advertisers' interests above yours. As Google turns your browser into an advertising agent, Privacy Badger will put your privacy first."", 'If you don’t already have Privacy Badger, install it now to automatically opt out of Privacy Sandbox and the broader ecosystem of online tracking. Already have Privacy Badger? You’re all set! And of course, don’t hesitate to spread the word to friends and family you want to protect from invasive online tracking. With your help, Privacy Badger will keep fighting to end online tracking and build a safer internet for all. ', 'Google has rolled out ""Privacy Sandbox,"" a Chrome feature first announced back in 2019 that, among other things, exchanges third-party cookies—the most common form of tracking technology—for what the company is now calling ""Topics.""

Your work isn’t going to waste. In fact, the plan is to continue to invest in them, continued Chavez, to further improve “privacy and utility.” Plus, additional privacy controls, like the recently announced IP Protection (i.e. IP masking for privacy protection) in Chrome’s Incognito mode, will be added to the Sandbox.', '“We developed the Privacy Sandbox with the goal of finding innovative solutions that meaningfully improve online privacy while preserving an ad-supported internet that supports a vibrant ecosystem of publishers, connects businesses with customers, and offers all of us free access to a wide range of content,” Chavez wrote in the blog post.', 'Or, to put it another way, the Sandbox isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.', 'This could be a blessing in disguise, especially if Google’s plan gets Chrome users to opt out of third-party cookies. Since it’s all about giving people a choice, if a bunch of users decide cookies aren’t for them, the APIs in the sandbox might actually work for targeting them without cookies.', 'The emphasis here is on “could,” given all the technical hiccups the Sandbox has right now.', 'But if this does pan out, it wouldn’t be too different from what Apple did with mobile identifiers three years ago. Back then, it launched a privacy safeguard called App Tracking Transparency, which lets people say yay or nay to sharing their data or Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) with apps and sites via a prompt.', 'Then again, Google might throw the industry a curveball. If the whole saga of third-party cookies has taught ad execs anything, it’s to expect the unexpected.', 'In the meantime, ad execs can expect Google to put on a full-court press to sell the Sandbox. It’s no coincidence that the decision to keep third-party cookies in Chrome dropped alongside an announcement about how well their own tests of alternatives performed between January and March.', 'The tests showed promising results:', 'The findings suggest that Privacy Sandbox technologies can help recover ad performance without third-party cookies. But let’s not break out the champagne just yet — these results are preliminary, and there’s still plenty of work to be done. Google’s well aware of this, especially with feedback pouring in from the ad industry and the CMA in the U.K.', 'Still, knowing that the Sandbox isn’t the be-all and end-all of Google’s plan for third-party addressability will have ad execs breathing a sigh of relief. They’ve been scratching their heads trying to figure out how this could all play out.', 'Somewhere between announcing the plan to ditch third-party cookies in Chrome four years ago and now, Google’s strategy got tangled between pleasing privacy advocates and keeping ad performance (and monetization) humming for the ad industry.', 'Publishers, in particular, have struggled to make sense of this predicament for their own businesses. Their faith in the Privacy Sandbox has been waning over the past several months. Execs told Digiday that only being able to test the Sandbox on 1% of Chrome users made the experimentation pool too small to draw definitive conclusions on its performance. Then in April, when Google announced it was delaying the deprecation of third-party cookies again, several publishers said they stopped allocating further resources to testing the sandbox altogether.', 'Some media execs told Digiday at the time that they were still allowing larger entities like Criteo and Index Exchange to use their inventory for larger scaled tests, but once their findings were published earlier this summer, the publishers realized that the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze when it came to performing any tests in-house. And as of July, Criteo reported that the publisher adoption rate of the Privacy Sandbox was below 55% and would likely remain that way for some time. Latency issues and average ad revenue losses were two of the larger concerns with the Privacy Sandbox that publishers voiced following the reports.', '“We 100% divested from Privacy Sandbox testing once they pushed the timeline on deprecation,” Justin Wohl, CRO of Snopes and TV Tropes, said earlier this month, adding that it was unsustainable for smaller publishers to be spending time or money on the Sandbox at this time.', 'The Olympic moment comes at a time that is all too critical for a brand like Nike, which some industry experts say is pressured to improve its standing among consumers after seeing a dip in sales as of late.', 'GoDaddy is moving away from its quintessential sports-related spots to focus on small businesses and entrepreneurs, according to CMO Fara Howard.', 'While the communication strategy for the Democrats already included robust digital and social media placements that have become table stakes, those efforts will likely only increase in the weeks to come.', ""Get Digiday's top stories every morning in your email inbox."", 'Follow @Digiday for the latest news, insider access to events and more.']"

We’re discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out.”', 'Which brings to an end essentially five years of consternation among industry folk.', 'To recap, back in 2020, Google announced its initial plan to phase out cookie tracking, initially by 2022, which was in line with the broader shift towards enhanced data privacy and control for web users. Google’s phase out plan included the development of its new Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) model, which would still enable a level of user activity tracking, though without the personal identifiers that could be tied to any specific user.', 'But that plan was challenged, by many in various industries, and as a result, in 2021, Google announced that it was delaying the FLoC plan with a view to establishing a better solution that would address all requirements.', 'Google then switched focus to its Privacy Sandbox project, which had been in production for some time as a lesser element. Google launched Privacy Sandbox for public use in September 2023, and by January 2024, it had a new plan in place to use the project as the alternative replacement for cookies, with the updated system set to categorize web users into topic categories, as opposed to facilitating individual tracking.', 'Google’s Privacy Sandbox was set to replace cookies by Q3 this year.', 'But that didn’t go ahead either.', 'After various concerns were raised, by various industry and regulatory bodies, Google delayed the cookie phase out once again. This was primarily due to a challenge from the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which had raised various concerns in regards to how the move would impact the broader digital marketing industry, and Google’s competitors in the space.', 'That ultimately meant that Google’s cookie phase out was delayed till at least 2025, but now, it’s not going ahead at all, as Google has had enough of trying to appease the various players.', '“We’re grateful to all the organizations and individuals who have worked with us over the last four years to develop, test and adopt the Privacy Sandbox. And as we finalize this approach, we’ll continue to consult with the CMA, ICO and other regulators globally. We look forward to continued collaboration with the ecosystem on the next phase of the journey to a more private web.”', 'Google says that it will continue to make its Privacy Sandbox APIs available, and that it’ll keep investing in them to further improve privacy and utility, so there will still be alternatives based on this model.', 'But it won’t be the only one, and Google won’t be retiring tracking cookies outright, at least not yet.', 'Which will mean that many industry folk can breathe a sigh of relief at not having to implement all new systems and processes to facilitate data tracking. Things will still change, of course, but at least for the time being, the status quo will remain the same in the data space.', 'It’s a surprising shift for the company, which had seemed determined to make the switch, riding on the back of Apple’s enhanced data privacy updates, including its controversial App Tracking Transparency switch in 2022. That seemed to open the door for Google’s new approach, but Google was hesitant to make any significant change that could impact its core ads business, and/or bring more regulatory scrutiny.', 'As a result, Google has revised and delayed till it seemingly felt it had no chance of appeasing all parties. So it’s now changing tack, which will see an all-new data privacy approach from the app.', 'What form that will take is not clear as yet, but as Google notes, it’ll be based around user choice, and empowering each individual to limit what data they share.', 'That, based on historical evidence, could end up being a big win for advertisers, as most users simply won’t make any changes to their settings. But then again, if Google starts prompting users with pop-ups, like Apple does with ATT, that could also end up being significantly worse too, and see much less user data flowing through.', 'We’ll have to wait and see, but for now, cookies are here to stay.', 'Stay on the pulse of the latest manufacturing industry news and what it means for leaders like you with Manufacturing Dive’s Daily Dive.', 'Get started ➔', 'The key to maximizing a social media marketing strategy is to ground the approach in purpose.', 'For months, we’ve been tracking Elon Musk’s $44 billion deal with Twitter.

Just months earlier, as testing began, Google had disabled third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users globally.', 'The decision to introduce a new user “experience” in lieu of sunsetting third-party cookies was made after much consideration of feedback “from a wide variety of stakeholders, including regulators like the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry,” wrote Chavez.', 'Regulators, in particular, have been a thorn in Google’s side. In January, the UK’s antitrust enforcer, the CMA, flagged 39 unique concerns about Google’s Privacy Sandbox.', 'Outside of antitrust concerns, recent research has also indicated that Google’s Privacy Sandbox terms may, ironically, violate privacy laws.', 'Google says it claims it will continue working with the CMA and other regulatory bodies to hone its Privacy Sandbox offerings and its new privacy prompt. “We’re discussing this new path with regulators and will engage with the industry as we roll this out,” Chavez wrote.', ""A CMA spokesperson reacted to Google’s revised plans today, saying in a statement: “We intervened and put in place commitments in 2022 because of concerns that Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals could distort competition by causing advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google's ecosystem at the expense of its competitors. We will need to carefully consider Google’s new approach to Privacy Sandbox, working closely with the ICO in this regard, and welcome views on Google's revised approach – including possible implications for consumers and market outcomes.”"", 'Outside of regulators’ concerns, the advertising and publishing industry has been exerting additional pressure on Google. Among the sector’s key concerns is Privacy Sandbox’s impact on advertising effectiveness and campaign performance.', 'In February, the IAB Tech Lab, a nonprofit digital advertising consortium, released a 106-page gap analysis that indicated that transitioning from third-party cookies to Google’s Privacy Sandbox would substantially hinder most current forms of digital advertising. According to the analysis, only a fraction of the 44 basic digital advertising use cases reviewed would remain feasible with the APIs provided by the Sandbox. Google disputed the IAB Tech Lab’s assertions, claiming the group’s report was rooted in “many misunderstandings and inaccuracies.”', 'Other major industry players have raised similar concerns. After two months of testing, adtech firm Criteo determined that Google’s Privacy Sandbox, the company’s suite of proposed cookie alternatives, would erase publishers’ ad revenues by 60%.', 'Now, with plans to expand third-party cookie user controls in Chrome, Google is maintaining its argument that ad performance will remain strong even in lieu of cookies.', 'The company says that recent tests conducted by Google Ads suggest that Privacy Sandbox APIs can deliver strong results. In experiments run between January and March of this year, which employed Privacy Sandbox tools, including its Topics API, Protected Audience API and Attribution Reporting API, Google saw an 89% recovery of ad spend in Google Display Ads and an 86% recovery of ad spend in Display & Video 360 (DV360). For performance campaigns focused solely on conversions, Google says it recorded a 97% recovery in conversions per dollar for Google Display Ads and a 95% recovery for DV360.', 'Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.', 'See the best ads of the last week - all in one place.', 'Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.', 'Remarketing campaigns, meanwhile, showed a 55% advertiser spend recovery in Google Ads and 49% in DV360. This comparatively low recovery rate, Google says, can be attributed to remarketing’s reliance on third-party cookies for precise personalization – as well as limited inventory due to the fact that many supply-side platforms are not testing Privacy Sandbox APIs. In its research, Google found that campaigns that combined remarketing with other strategies like optimized targeting and affinity audiences witnessed better returns.', 'Further experiments found that publishers could mitigate revenue losses from the removal of third-party cookies by using Privacy Sandbox APIs in combination with other approaches, like first-party data. Without Privacy Sandbox, Google Ad Manager’s programmatic revenue dropped by 34%, and Google AdSense’s revenue fell by 21%. When Privacy Sandbox was implemented, however, these dips were 20% for Google Ad Manager and 18% for Google AdSense.', '“Our latest Privacy Sandbox experiment showed overall progress in driving performance without third-party cookies when using a combination of privacy-preserving signals, with room for continued improvements,” a Google Ads spokesperson tells The Drum. “While our findings are directional, we expect results to keep evolving as others across the industry adopt the APIs and enhance their use.”', 'Chavez says that Google will continue developing Privacy Sandbox APIs and will also debut new privacy measures. For instance, the company plans to offer IP address obfuscation in Chrome’s Incognito mode.', '“We expect that overall performance using Privacy Sandbox APIs will improve over time as industry adoption increases,” Chavez wrote. “At the same time, we recognize this transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising.”', 'Google plans to continue refining Privacy Sandbox technologies in the coming months.', '© Carnyx Group Ltd 2024 | The Drum is a Registered Trademark and property of Carnyx Group Limited.

The company said it would replace those cookies with its own “Privacy Sandbox” technology that would let advertisers target users with the most appropriate ads."", 'It pitched the idea as a way to “increase the privacy of web browsing,” but the plan kept hitting roadblocks—and yesterday Google all but abandoned it. What happened is pretty complicated—and it’s this complexity, reflecting the conflicting imperatives of the various players in the web ecosystem, that was Google’s undoing.', 'Third-party cookies—that is to say, cookies left in a browser that share or record information across multiple websites—give advertising technology companies a way to create profiles of users’ interests, which is how much of the online economy is funded. But it’s also creepy and something that many people would rather avoid.', 'Back in 2019, Google acknowledged the problems with third-party cookies by setting up the Privacy Sandbox project with the aim of letting users “control how their information is collected.” At the start of 2020, it said the idea was so promising that it could “sustain a healthy, ad-supported web in a way that will render third-party cookies obsolete.” Google claimed it would therefore phase out Chrome’s support for third-party cookies within two years.', 'As Google’s general manager of ads at the time, Jerry Dischler, explained in a Fortune commentary, the new approach would see Google itself take over the task of tracking users’ interests. Users would be put into groups based on those interests—AI would do the sorting—and advertisers would target ads at the groups, rather than individuals. This technology was called FLoC, which stood for “federated learning of cohorts.”', 'The problem is, Google is kind of a big deal in online advertising. So privacy advocates were skeptical that it suddenly had their interests at heart, and other ad-tech players cried foul, claiming that Google was trying to strengthen its monopoly in the space while making it harder for advertisers to track how well their ads were performing. This backlash had its most notable effect in the U.K., where the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened a case, in close cooperation with the country’s privacy regulator. (The issue also plays a part in an antitrust lawsuit against Google by the State of Texas, which is due to go to trial next year, and in a series of complaints to European competition authorities.)', ""One broker tried to rush out a note recommending investors buy the dip, only to find out his bank's computers were CrowdStriked too."", 'Meta Platforms released the biggest version of its mostly free Llama 3 artificial intelligence models on Tuesday, boasting multilingual skills and general performance metrics that nip at the heels of paid models from rivals like OpenAI.

Instead, it appears to be suggesting that users should be given a choice to accept or deny ad tracking at the browser level.', 'Google’s move will be subject to regulatory oversight in the U.K., so it is not yet confirmed. Still, it could cast doubt on the uptake of Privacy Sandbox, its long-brewing alternative tech stack for personalized ad targeting that does not use cookies to track and profile users.', '“[W]e are proposing an updated approach that elevates user choice. Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We’re discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out,” Google’s VP of Privacy Sandbox, Anthony Chavez, wrote in a blog post on Monday.', 'The adtech giant has been pitching Privacy Sandbox as a less privacy-hostile alternative to third-party cookies. But if Google isn’t ending support for tracking cookies after all, there’s no obvious hard stop or deadline to force advertisers to switch en masse to a less intrusive alternative.', 'It’s notable the search and advertising giant is not pulling the plug on Privacy Sandbox itself, though. On the contrary, Google’s blog post says it will keep working on the tech stack — Chavez asserted it “remains important for developers to have privacy-preserving alternatives.”', '“We’ll continue to make the Privacy Sandbox APIs available and invest in them to further improve privacy and utility. We also intend to offer additional privacy controls, so we plan to introduce IP Protection into Chrome’s Incognito mode,” he wrote, adding: “We’re grateful to all the organizations and individuals who have worked with us over the last four years to develop, test and adopt the Privacy Sandbox.”', 'On the one hand, Google’s announcement is a surprise, as it has been working toward this stated aim for at least four years in response to rising concern (and reputational risk) over tracking-based privacy risks. The company actually began talking about building a “Privacy Sandbox” for ad targeting all the way back in 2019.', 'On the other hand, something had to give. The company’s plan to kill support for tracking cookies has faced heavy and sustained pushback from advertisers and publishers from the get go. Their complaints triggered close regulatory scrutiny in early 2021, principally from the U.K.’s competition regulator, the CMA. The U.K.’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, has also been involved in oversight of Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposal.', 'The saga is particularly interesting, as it offers a microcosm of arguments that seek to frame competition and privacy as opposing forces that are perpetually and fatally in tension. In practice, so far the upshot has been a much slowed/delayed transition — Google has been forced to consult and take industry feedback on proposed changes to its ad-serving and tracking mechanism after it agreed to let the CMA monitor the design and implementation of its alternative adtech stack.', 'The relative weakness of the U.K.’s privacy oversight versus competition enforcement is a key strand here — one that the ad industry has sought to leverage to their advantage via competition complaints against Privacy Sandbox.', 'The ICO has been infamously weak at standing up to tracking by the ads industry, despite the regulator’s public acknowledgement (since 2019) that cookie-based tracking and profiling violates privacy laws. By pitting competition complaints against privacy rights, the ad industry has been banking on the CMA to prevail as the regulatory champion and deal Google’s Privacy Sandbox a knock-out blow.', 'In particular, advertisers claim Privacy Sandbox would further entrench Google’s dominance in the adtech space, as it would then become the owner and operator of reconfigured targeting infrastructure designed to shield user data from third-party access. In turn, that would make advertisers and publishers even more reliant on Google, even as (they claim) the resulting non-cookie-based ad targeting would be less lucrative for them.', 'Some publishers have said their revenue had declined by about a third during early tests of Google’s Sandbox. However, if cookie tracking is unlawful because it violates people’s privacy, some might say the industry needs to be OK with earning a lot less. (Breaking the law might be great business, but it’s not legal business, yo.)', 'The ICO told TechCrunch it’s “disappointed” that Google no longer intends to deprecate third-party cookies in Chrome.', '“From the start of Google’s Sandbox project in 2019, it has been our view that blocking third-party cookies would be a positive step for consumers,” said the ICO’s deputy commissioner, Stephen Bonner, in a statement. “The new plan set out by Google is a significant change and we will reflect on this new course of action when more detail is available.', '“Our ambition to support the creation of a more privacy-friendly internet continues. Despite Google’s decision, we continue to encourage the digital advertising industry to move to more private alternatives to third-party cookies — and not to resort to more opaque forms of tracking.”', '“We will monitor how the industry responds and consider regulatory action where systemic non-compliance is identified for all companies including Google,” Bonner added.', 'We also reached out to the CMA about Google’s move, but it declined to respond to questions about whether it would accept a proposal to let Chrome users deny tracking. Instead, it said in a statement: “We will need to carefully consider Google’s new approach to Privacy Sandbox, working closely with the ICO in this regard, and welcome views on Google’s revised approach — including possible implications for consumers and market outcomes.”', '“We intervened and put in place commitments in 2022 because of concerns that Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals could distort competition by causing advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors,” the CMA added, emphasizing that competition concerns are its mainstay.', 'With the future of Privacy Sandbox (and much more) hanging in the balance, Google’s proposal of a third way that hinges on centering consumer choice could offer the two U.K. regulators an elegantly simple — if ironic — way out of this competition versus privacy impasse: Just let the users decide!', 'It’s ironic because had the ICO actually enforced data protection laws on the adtech industry in the first place, the industry would already have had to ask and obtain people’s consent to track and profile them.', 'Instead, we’ve had years of consent theater, where the web has been flooded with annoying (and illegal) pop-ups that employ deceptive mechanisms to confuse, manipulate or simply steal consent — doing everything except presenting users with the clear and informed choice U.K. and EU laws require.', 'All these years of adtech privacy outrages are essentially water under the bridge at this point, but the future direction of the web (and the business models it supports) is still up for grabs. The next few months — and what this pair of U.K. regulators decide — will be important.', 'In a blog post discussing Google’s gambit, privacy and security researcher Lukasz Olejnik has sketched a mock-up of a potential choice screen Chrome could present to users. Does he think the CMA would accept Google implementing such a choice?', '“That depends on the developments in the next two months, but I can’t imagine regulators not giving users an option of choice,” he told TechCrunch. “That would be bizarre. And perhaps this is why Google maintains, at least today, that Privacy Sandbox is here to stay. But there must be an incentive to shift to the use of PS. If there is none, why keep it?”', 'But would an unblockable prompt in Chrome that asks users to choose whether they see ads based on their web activity (or not), or deny ad tracking altogether by disabling third-party cookies, constitute a win for consumers hoping for more privacy? “I hope so,” Olejnik said, suggesting that there’s a chance “user choice may thusly steer the future.”', 'Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.', 'Startups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.', 'The latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.', 'TechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.', 'Digital banking startup Mercury informed some founders that it is no longer serving customers in certain countries, including Ukraine.', 'Welcome to TechCrunch Fintech!

You’re not alone. The 2024 stock market often feels like a rollercoaster, with conflicting analysis and opinions everywhere you go.\n\nFinding GOOGL’s fair value is easier when there’s a proven, profitable way to do it.\n\nThe use of AI and machine learning for predicting potential profitable stocks sets it apart from traditional financial tools that rely on historical data. This system predicts a stock's performance compared to a main index like S&P 500, assesses the confidence level of these predictions, and estimates potential downside risk.\n\nThe best part about this analysis and stock picks is that we cut through the noise and deliver the bottom line for you: each stock’s fair value.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line on GOOGL?""]"

It depends. Are you an internet user who cares about privacy? An internet publisher who cares about making money? Or somewhere in between?', 'On Monday afternoon, Google shocked the online-advertising world by saying that, actually, despite years of promises, it wouldn’t be dropping cookies from its world-dominant web browser, Chrome. If you’re not deep into the surveillance-capitalism game, here’s Richard Lawler at The Verge to explain:', 'Now, Chrome will ask users to “make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing” instead of deprecating third-party cookies, writes Google Privacy Sandbox VP Anthony Chavez. That could work more like Apple’s app tracking opt-in, a setting that reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion when it rolled out in 2021. Putting a prompt in front of Chrome’s billions of users wouldn’t be as drastic as changing the default entirely, but it still might cut the number of users allowing third-party tracking significantly.', 'Some background. The issue here rests on the uncomfortable truth that publishers’ ad revenue depends heavily on being able to know enough about their users to serve them a useful ad — or, at least, an ad that seems well enough aligned to the user that an advertiser is willing to pay more for it. In general, publishers themselves don’t know this information; they instead give a substantial cut of their ad revenue to an adtech company that has this data — the largest of these by far being Google itself. And the main way that data is gathered is via third-party cookies, the tiny data files stored in your browser that connect your activity on Sites A, B, C, and D to the same user profile.', 'These cookies are, understandably, anathema to privacy advocates. The idea that, on any given pageview, dozens of faceless companies might be updating their dossiers on your habits isn’t especially pleasant. And the two companies that had by far the largest caches of user data — Google and Facebook/Meta — used that setup to become the world-bestriding Duopoly they are today.', 'Enter Apple. Unlike Google and Facebook, Apple doesn’t make much of its money on selling advertising, and it considers privacy a core feature of its shiny glass rectangles. In 2020, it announced it was blocking all third-party cookies in Safari, the browser on iPhones and iPads. In 2021, it extended the system to apps by requiring users to approve (or disapprove) each app that wants to track users across the ecosystem. (You know, all those “Ask App Not to Track” buttons you’ve tapped.) This had a major impact on the adtech world, costing Facebook literal billions. Firefox later followed suit.', 'Google said it wanted to get on board, announcing it would start blocking third-party cookies by 2022. Then it postponed it to 2023. Then 2024. Then 2025. And now, 2025’s out. How about never — is never good for you?', 'Google proposed a number of replacements for the cookie regime over the years, most notably Privacy Sandbox, which promised cookie-like identifiability without tying the data so easily to an individual. But both competitors and regulators expressed concern that Privacy Sandbox didn’t go far enough in protecting privacy and would, in effect, lock in Google’s preeminence in online advertising. One adtech company estimated trading cookies for Privacy Sandbox would lead publishers to “lose an average of 60% of their revenue from Chrome.” In April, U.K. regulators said that it “leaves gaps that can be exploited to undermine privacy and identify users who should be kept anonymous.” Here’s the Electronic Frontier Foundation:', 'So we’re back at square one. Cookies aren’t going anywhere in the world’s most-used web browser. For the adtech industry, that’s a win. But if you’re an online publisher, it’s not clear how to react. The old bad system that made Google a lot of money and you a pittance…sticks around. Yay, maybe? “Phew, we dodged that somewhat-less-privacy-violating but somewhat-less-money-making-for-us alternative to our current bad setup”? Privacy Sandbox was an imperfect replacement, but no replacement at all has its problems too. Google now says it wants instead to “elevate user choice” by letting Chrome users “make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time.” That could, depending on how it’s enforced, lead to the loss of many third-party cookies — but we have no details, only a Google promise to “engage with the industry as we roll this out.”', 'The best solution for publishers, as always, is to work on gathering their own first-party data to allow targeting without all the privacy leaks. But that requires scale the vast majority don’t have, and publishers haven’t always proven themselves skilled at playing together. Either way, publishers are still pawns in a game they don’t control.', 'Covering thought leadership in journalism', 'Exploring the art and craft of story']"

The company says, ""this transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising.""', 'As such, Google announced it is changing tactics on its privacy plans for online advertising: While the company will be abandoning its push to retire cookies, it will be introducing a new option in Chrome that, ""lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing."" Google fell short of explaining exactly how this ""informed choice"" works, but users will have the option to change their choice at any time. The company also confirmed it is working with regulators on this feature now, and will keep the industry informed as they roll out the option to users.', 'However this feature works, putting the onus on users, rather than disabling tracking by default (which is how it works on Safari and Firefox) is a shame—especially considering how popular Google\'s browser is. That said, it may be similar to how Apple\'s ""App Tracking Transparency"" works: You may open Chrome, and be asked whether you\'d like to block cookies from tracking your internet activity. You can then choose whether to block that tracking, or allow it. Most people, of course, will likely choose to block this tracking, as is what happened on iOS.', ""All that said, retiring cookies for good would be the optimal path for preserving user privacy on the web. While some cookies are essential for websites to run properly (they're what's responsible for keeping you logged in, remembering what's in your shopping cart, etc.), most cookies are used by advertisers and other companies to track your activity across websites. You can think of them like an ID badge, containing a ton of personal information about you, your device, and your past activity."", ""Google wanted to replace cookies with a new policy: the Privacy Sandbox. The idea is, instead of tracking individual users' activity, Google would compile your browsing data with others like it, and anonymize the bunch. Then it would share this data pool with advertisers. These companies would still get relevant data, without being able to tie it directly to you and your activity. It isn't great, since we'd still hand Google a ton of data, but it would be better than modern cookies. You can learn more about how both cookies and the Privacy Sandbox work in my explainer here."", 'Even though Google isn\'t killing cookies for good, Chrome still lets you block them if you want to. To start, go to Privacy and security in Chrome\'s Settings. Under ""Default behavior,"" choose Block third-party cookies. Just be warned without cookies enabled, some site features may not work.

Harris race puts two competing ideas of Christianity on display', 'Following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will no longer seek re-election in November, the 2024 presidential race juxtaposes two very different versions of Christianity: Donald Trump brandishes a performative rendition of the Christian faith as a political prop to advance authoritarian theocracy, while Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden has endorsed to take his place as the Democratic nominee, practices the Christian faith she was raised in, while embracing her interfaith family. ', 'In doing so, Harris embodies our nation’s founding ideal of religious freedom and models a Christian commitment to religious pluralism. ', 'Although he has reportedly mocked his conservative Christian leaders behind their backs, was not active in church before running for president and says he’s never asked God for forgiveness, Trump has manufactured mass far-right devotion among his base through moves like overturning Roe v. Wade. Surviving an assassination attempt will only heighten MAGA zealotry, as we saw with the surge of Christian nationalist narrative claiming Trump survived only by the will of God. ', 'Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church.', 'Harris grew up attending 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland. “I was raised to live my faith,” she said at the National Baptist Convention, USA, Annual Meeting in 2022. “Marching for civil rights, my parents pushed me in a stroller. That was faith in action.” I’ve witnessed her put her faith in action on the national stage. Four days after Biden picked her to be his running mate in 2020, I was invited by the Biden-Harris campaign to attend a meeting between her and national faith leaders. We heard directly from the Rev. Dr. Amos Brown, her pastor at Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. It was clear from the very beginning of her national political career that she would not shy away from talking about her Baptist convictions. Harris once served as Rev. Brown’s campaign manager when he ran for re-election to the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. “She is an encourager; she encourages all people regardless of their social station in life,” Rev. Brown shared with Baptist news outlet Word&Way. “She is a role model for womanhood, and just human decency and dignity at its best.” ', 'Harris roots her personal Christian faith in the prophetic tradition of the Black Church. “Just think, after slavery was outlawed in our country, the founders of this very convention came together to protect the freedom of worship,” she said at the National Baptist Convention. “As Black people in our nation battled racist laws and ideologies, men and women of the cloth were the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement in America. And they, then, following the teachings of Christ, built coalitions of people of all faiths and races and walks of life, because they understood and knew the importance of the collective.”', '“I can trace my belief in the importance of public service back to learning the parable of the good Samaritan and other biblical teachings about looking out for our neighbors,” she said in a Religion News Service interview in 2020. ', '“Ever since I was a girl, church has not only been a place where I draw strength, it’s been a place for reflection, a place to study the teachings of the Lord and to feel grounded in a complex world,” she told RNS. “Church still plays that role for me. And I also draw something else from it as well: a sense of community and belonging where we can build lasting relationships and be there for one another in times of need.”', 'Harris grew up in an interfaith family and chose to form an interfaith family as an adult. Her mother, an immigrant from India, took her to visit Hindu temples growing up. Harris has said this teaches her “to see that all faiths teach us to pursue justice.” If elected, Harris’ husband Douglas Emhoff wouldn’t just be the first person to hold the title of first gentleman. He’d also the first Jewish spouse of a president. ', ""Must reads from Today's list"", '“From all of these traditions and teachings, I’ve learned that faith is not only something we express in church and prayerful reflection, but also in the way we live our lives, do our work and pursue our respective callings,” Harris said about the Hindu and Jewish influences in her life. ', 'Emhoff has also been a leader in the Biden-Harris administration at fostering interfaith dialogue and collaboration. I heard him speak at an interfaith iftar at the U.S. Institute of Peace in 2022 during Ramadan. Harris and Emhoff hosted an Eid al-Adha celebration in 2023, the first Eid celebration at the vice president’s residence. ', 'One of the most exciting aspects of Harris’ potential candidacy is that she doesn’t shy away from making the religious case for abortion rights, meeting head on Trump’s alliance of Christian nationalist groups pushing to outlaw abortion on so-called religious claims. ', 'Harris spoke on this matter at the National Baptist Convention:', '“As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. And she will choose, in consultation with her pastor or her priest, or a doctor and her loved ones. But the government should not be making that decision.”', 'Harris’ boldness is representative, as most Christians in the United States support abortion rights. ', 'In 2021, Rev. Lauren Jones Mayfield was invited to the White House to participate in a roundtable discussion on reproductive health care with Harris. “Harris honored my religious voice as I intended for her to hear it, a deep valuing of American religious liberty and reproductive freedoms,” Jones Mayfield told me. “The vice president made clear her own support for reproductive health for all Americans alongside her ongoing commitments to religious liberty. For those of us who engage in reproductive rights activism of our faith, not in spite of it, Harris honored our collective, clerical voice that celebrates the American right for a patient to choose their best course of medical treatment with their doctor, family and faith leader if it’s so desired.”', 'Rooted in the Black Church tradition, deeply informed and inspired by her interfaith family, and a trailblazer for reproductive freedom, Kamala Harris’ Christian faith is the antithesis of Donald Trump’s Christian nationalism, in which the Christian faith is wielded as a tool to oppress, exclude and limit basic rights of people who believe or pray differently. ', 'If elected president, she would make history on multiple fronts: the first female president, the second Black president, and the first president of South Asian descent. She’ll also be a role model for confidently living out your faith in public while respecting others’ religious values.', 'Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons is a religion contributor and the author of ""Just Faith: Reclaiming Progressive Christianity.""', ""Catch up on more stories from MSNBC Daily featuring the top voices and opinions driving today's conversation""]"

Josh Shapiro has emerged as a top contender for the vice-presidential nod following President Joe Biden’s stunning announcement that he is dropping out of the 2024 race and endorsing Kamala Harris to take his spot on the ballot.', 'Shapiro, 51, was elected Pennsylvania’s governor in 2022 and assumed office in January 2023. He is a moderate Democrat whose career trajectory has seen him move from congressional aide to Pennsylvania’s chief executive, all within two decades.', 'Already, top elected Democrats in Pennsylvania like state House Speaker Joanna McClinton and party leaders like Philadelphia Democratic chair Bob Brady have endorsed Shapiro as a possible vice presidential pick, citing his wins in a divided General Assembly and electoral success in a key swing state.', 'At a Monday afternoon event in Pittsburgh, Shapiro said he has spoken to both Biden and Harris, but declined to say whether he is in talks to join the ticket.', '“We spoke only about defeating Donald Trump and our shared commitment to that. I immediately gave her my endorsement and said I would do everything in my power to support her here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said of his Sunday conversation with Harris.', ""He added, “This is a deeply personal decision that the vice president will make. She will make it on her own timetable and her own timeline. She needs to choose someone that she's prepared to govern with, campaign with, and someone that she feels most comfortable with, and that decision should be made free of any sort of political pressure.”"", 'Unlike other rumored picks, like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Shapiro did not rule out the idea of running for vice president during the Monday event.', 'If Shapiro were to be tapped as a vice presidential candidate, he would be able to campaign while simultaneously serving as governor.', 'SIGN UP', 'The son of a pediatrician and educator who grew up in Philadelphia’s suburbs, Shapiro initially planned to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. But a few months into his freshman year at Rochester University, he nearly flunked his organic chemistry class. Around the same time, his dream of playing college basketball was shattered when he was cut from the university’s basketball team.', 'A knock on his dorm room door not long after would end up launching his career in public service, and later, politics: It was a fellow student, asking him if he would run for student government. He did — and won.', 'He hasn’t lost a bid for public office since.', 'In his 20s, he worked as a congressional aide on Capitol Hill while also getting his law degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.', 'In 2004, he ran for a seat representing Montgomery County in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives. He won, and remained in the state House for four two-year terms, during which he came to be known as a policy wonk and, later, a strategist who helped Democrats cement a razor-thin voting advantage in the chamber.', 'His first statewide run for office came in 2016 when he launched his successful campaign to helm the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, which had just come off four tumultuous and scandal-plagued years under Democratic predecessor Kathleen Kane.', 'He ran for governor in 2022 against a Trump-endorsed candidate, state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R., Franklin). Shapiro cast the race as a referendum on preserving democracy and constitutionally protected freedoms, including the right to abortion.', 'Again, Shapiro handily won the election and, in the process, shattered records for the most money ever spent on a governor’s race in Pennsylvania.', 'Shapiro, an observant Conservative Jew, has frequently said that his faith played prominently into his decision to enter public service.', 'Many of Shapiro’s key achievements came while he was Pennsylvania’s attorney general.', 'His office investigated the role of pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors in the nation’s opioid crisis, and prosecuted natural gas companies.', 'But his legacy there was irrevocably shaped by his office’s scathing grand jury report on child sexual abuse and its coverup in nearly every Roman Catholic diocese in Pennsylvania. The investigation — which Kane, his predecessor, had initiated — sparked similar inquiries across the nation and landed Shapiro on television screens across the globe.', 'As attorney general, Shapiro positioned himself as a foil to the values and policies of Trump and his administration.', 'He joined other Democratic attorneys general in suing the administration over its family-separation policy for migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border; and over a rule that would have allowed employers more leeway in denying birth control coverage mandates under the Affordable Care Act.', 'Shapiro’s office was also the one in court defending Pennsylvania’s election results, which came under attack by Trump and his surrogates in the weeks after Trump’s loss to Biden in the 2020 election.', 'Less than two weeks after Shapiro took office as governor, he had to contend with a crisis when a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, less than a mile from Pennsylvania’s border, and released thousands of tons of toxic chemicals.', 'Then, amid state budget talks, an overpass on I-95 suddenly collapsed after a truck fire. The bridge was used by tens of thousands of Philadelphia commuters every day, and its failure required Shapiro to coordinate a temporary replacement in less than two weeks while under national scrutiny.', 'The speed with which the highway was rebuilt, and Shapiro’s visibility during the project — hovering over the collapse in a helicopter, setting up a construction live stream, holding enthusiastic media briefings — won him national attention.', 'As governor, Shapiro has negotiated two budgets with Pennsylvania’s divided state legislature — the only in the country — that dramatically increased funding for public education.', 'Budget negotiations during his first year in office were temporarily delayed after a politically embarrassing incident. As the June 30 deadline neared, the governor, according to multiple accounts, privately negotiated a deal with state Senate Republicans to create a taxpayer-funded school voucher plan. Democrats privately said they were blindsided by the move and refused to give their support to the proposal.', 'Despite Shapiro’s efforts to assuage members of his party, the governor was forced to abandon the plan.', 'Shapiro scored a major win in this year’s budget, securing $500 million for a program to prepare sites for industrial or mixed-use developments. Still, the final deal did not include several other key issues Shapiro advocated for, including sustainable funding for public transit and the legalization of adult-use recreational marijuana.', ""“There were some things we didn't get done this time,” Shapiro acknowledged during a news conference after signing the budget, “but in a productive democracy, this is how progress is made — by moving past partisan politics and having real conversations together.”"", 'One of the few controversies of Shapiro’s tenure as governor came courtesy of one of his oldest allies, his now-former legislative liaison Mike Vereb.', 'Shapiro and Vereb, a Republican, are both from Montgomery County and served together in the state House. When Shapiro became attorney general, he brought Vereb on as a top advisor. And when Shapiro was elected governor, Vereb was one of the few Republicans to join his staff, this time in a key role as the governor’s emissary to the legislature.', 'But in September, Vereb resigned. His departure came shortly after reporters had learned a staffer had filed a complaint against him alleging harassment that had begun shortly after the start of the administration.', 'Spotlight PA learned that the administration had quietly paid out $295,000 to settle the complaint three weeks before Vereb’s abrupt resignation. Shapiro would not discuss the matter in any detail, with his administration saying only that it handled the matter in a professional and timely manner.', 'That settlement isn’t the only matter about which Shapiro has been notably tight-lipped. Across the board, Shapiro’s administration has been markedly more opaque than previous governors’.', 'As Shapiro prepared to take office, he had members of his transition team sign nondisclosure agreements and would not say who paid for inauguration events.', 'Unlike his predecessor, who released detailed daily schedules, Shapiro has declined to regularly release information about who he meets with behind the scenes. He also categorizes his daily calendars as “personal” papers, which exempts them from the state’s Right-To-Know Law.', 'The governor also loosened a notoriously tight gift ban for his employees while arguing it would still protect against gifts from lobbyists influencing his agenda.', 'However, Shapiro has still accepted free tickets, including to the Super Bowl, paid for by unknown donors to a little-known fund managed by Team PA, a Harrisburg-based nonprofit of which the governor is a co-chair.', 'He also listed tickets to sporting events, from long-time donors and lobbyists, as campaign contributions.', 'The administration has argued this is all in compliance with the state’s ethics and campaign finance laws, which are among the most lax in the country, and that the gift ban doesn’t apply to Team PA.', 'Shapiro, one of the country’s most prominent Jewish politicians, has also taken a central role in condemning antisemitism and what he sees as weak responses to it in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people.', '“I am pro-the idea of a Jewish homeland, a Jewish state, and I will certainly do everything in my power to ensure that Israel is strong and Israel is fortified and will exist for generations,” Shapiro told the New York Times.', 'As protests against Israel’s war in Gaza — where the death toll now tops 39,000 — have escalated, Shapiro has argued some demonstrations have crossed a line into bigotry.', 'Amid rising protests against the war, the Shapiro administration updated the office’s code of conduct to bar “scandalous” conduct. An email accompanying the policy cited social media posts, boycotts, graffiti, and public confrontations as examples of potential “hate speech” that would not be tolerated.', 'He also backed a bipartisan bill that would strip state funding from any school that divests from Israel.', 'Before Biden announced he was stepping down, Shapiro, who has made many appearances as a surrogate for and supporter of Biden, said he stood by the president.', 'Soon after Biden announced he would not accept the nomination for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, Shapiro issued a statement giving her his full support.', '“I’ve known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades — we’ve both been prosecutors, we’ve both stood up for the rule of law, we’ve both fought for the people and delivered results,” Shapiro said in a statement released by his campaign office.', '“Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support and she will continue the work of generations of Americans who came before us to perfect our union, protect our democracy, and advance real freedom.

Jay Costa, a convention delegate, said the meeting took place at 1 p.m. Monday. Mr. Costa also said he doesn’t anticipate any other nationally known Democratic heavyweights will compete with Ms. Harris for the nomination, and he also expected support for Ms. Harris to be forthcoming from many other Democratic organizations in the state.', 'Mr. Costa, an Allegheny County resident and the top Democrat in the state Senate, said Ms. Harris is “the right person for the job” and was Democrats’ best option. Democrats in general, he said, have been lacking in enthusiasm for the presidential race and Mr. Biden’s endorsement of Ms. Harris “flipped the switch” on that dynamic overnight.', 'Reverberations from Mr. Biden’s weekend political bombshell were felt among state leaders Monday even as they continued to assess the aftermath of the attempted assassination the previous weekend of former President Donald Trump in Butler County. Prominent in the former topic and having a strong interest in the second topic was Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has been mentioned repeatedly as a possible running mate for Ms. Harris and even as a potential convention draftee pick for president.', 'A spokesperson for Mr. Shapiro, who is midway through his second year as governor, did not immediately provide answers to questions Monday morning. At an event in Pittsburgh later in the day, the governor demurred when asked about a possible national run, saying Ms. Harris has a ""deeply personal decision"" to make and that he wouldn’t “engage in hypotheticals.""', 'Top Republicans in the state Legislature criticized the notion of Mr. Shapiro seeking the vice presidency.', 'The Democratic governor previously served stints as state attorney general, state representative and Montgomery County commissioner.', 'Mr. Costa said the vice presidential slot was not discussed during the delegates’ meeting Monday.', 'Prior to the meeting, Mr. Costa said Mr. Shapiro had a “very successful record” as governor and “has the capability” to hold one of the national posts. Concerning the possibility of Mr. Shapiro being added to a potential ticket topped by Ms. Harris, Mr. Costa said, “He is one of a number of folks who are being considered.”', 'The mere fact that Mr. Shapiro is under consideration for a place on the ticket, Mr. Costa said, speaks well of how Pennsylvania has been run in the past 18 months. He ticked off many items worthy of praise in the just-completed state budget, led by the $1.1 billion increase in spending for K-12 education.', 'Other Democrats have praised deep involvement by his administration in the budget negotiations, which put a complete state spending plan in place four months earlier than last year. Mr. Shapiro is the only governor in the nation working with a divided state legislature, with the House controlled by Democrats and the Senate by Republicans.', 'In a midday news release, the Shapiro administration said that with the recent budget completion, Mr. Shapiro ""has proven once again that he can work with both parties to get stuff done and deliver real results for Pennsylvanians.""', 'Another top Democrat in Harrisburg, House Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County, on Sunday issued a statement of thanks to Mr. Biden, whom he said “has served the nation honorably for decades with kindness, empathy, and decency.”', 'Mr. Bradford added that Mr. Biden “led the nation out of a very dark time, and his policies showed us the path out of a worldwide pandemic. He built an incredible economy, strengthened our infrastructure, and created a brighter future for working families.”', 'Top Republicans, asked about the potential involvement of Mr. Shapiro in a national ticket, lambasted the concept.', 'Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, R-Westmoreland, said Mr. Shapiro has been aiming at a spot in national politics ever since he was sworn in as governor. She said she didn’t see how Mr. Shapiro could run for a national office and still pay attention to Pennsylvania.', 'She said it has been “difficult to work with him” because of what Ms. Ward described as Mr. Shapiro’s repeatedly taking positions in order to avoid angering the extreme left of his party.', 'And even though Mr. Shapiro often highlights the fact he must work with a divided Legislature, Ms. Ward said it gives the governor cover when he does not want to support a bill from one side or the other. Asked if she trusted him, Ms. Ward said, “If he tells me he is going to do something, I don’t trust that.”', 'Rep. Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster and the minority leader in the House, said “there is a lot that the governor could be focusing on here, rather than nationally.” He said that even though this year’s budget was not nearly as late as the previous one, he believed Mr. Shapiro’s budget performance was “0 for 2” because the most recent one included what Mr. Cutler described as a complete elimination of the budget surplus.', 'On the Trump assassination attempt, a spokesperson for House Speaker Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, said Ms. McClinton was “confident that the FBI and Congress have the tools necessary for comprehensive investigations,” including the cooperation of Pennsylvania State Police and local law enforcement. Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for House Democratic Majority Leader Matt Bradford of Montgomery County, issued a similar statement.', 'Mr. Cutler, on the other hand, said he has introduced a resolution in the House to form a bipartisan committee to probe the actions of state and local law enforcement, as well as their coordination with federal agencies, on the day of the shooting.', '“Pennsylvania is a political battleground state that will be the epicenter of many high-level campaign events during the remainder of the 2024 election season,” Mr. Cutler said. “It is imperative we identify what happened from a state and local perspective on July 13, as we seek to perfect our effectiveness at keeping citizens and candidates safe as they host campaign events in Pennsylvania.”', 'Mr. Cutler noted a number of upcoming high-profile events in the state, including the NFL draft in Pittsburgh, soccer World Cup events in Philadelphia, and the nation’s 250th anniversary celebration.', 'Ms. Ward said “obviously, something went terribly wrong” and it was clear more security would need to be in place at future events.', 'Ford Turner: fturner@post-gazette.com']"

They also questioned the enduring usefulness of the two-party system and how the decision will affect Biden’s legacy in the history books."", 'Here are their answers:', '“I think they’re both awful. I think Trump’s awful, I think the state of American politics is just beyond salvageable. Harris running is going to make sure Trump’s a winner. Harris is very inexperienced, she doesn’t have any foreign policy credentials. I just don’t think she’s up to the task. There were a lot of people who were on the fence that are going to now vote for Trump because Harris isn’t qualified. And just so you know, I’m a Nikki Haley fan.”', '“I think it’s what was required for us to move forward and have Donald Trump not be president. Biden was just getting too old and we need some younger people in there. Trump’s too old himself. I’m not sure if she’s strongest but I don’t know what else they could do at this point in time.”', '“I feel positive. I would have voted for Biden, but I definitely feel he’s declined in the past year. A lot of people say, ‘How come you now like Harris? You never see her?’ Well, if you don’t follow her you’re not on that algorithm, but she’s everywhere. She’s out talking to people, meeting people. She’s met world leaders. I feel really strongly that she does have a presence even if the ‘right’ obviously doesn’t follow her. I heard this morning that she already raised $50 million after Biden endorsed her, and we were behind after Trump’s assassination attempt, so that’s positive. But I think her VP pick will be crucial, and because there’s still misogyny in this country, I do feel like she should pick a man.”', '“Well, I’m kind of sorry because Harris probably has a chance now against Trump and I was hoping that Biden would stay in and then lose. I’ve lived in this country for 40 years, I went through the Reagan era, great prosperity, etc., then I went through Clinton and Obama and I see this country increasingly have problems, inflation, internationally, etc. Then when Trump came in, this country was doing great.”', 'William Bridges, 21, Durango', '“It’s kind of just like another day for me. It’s just Monday. There are a lot of challenges the Democrats still have to face, like not going through the nomination process democratically and having a cherry-picked candidate. But I think anyone who voted for Biden in 2020 probably thought that Kamala might get the presidency because Biden was old as (crap). I’m more of a leftist of the political spectrum so I think the current American two-party system doesn’t favor the American people.”', ""“I think it was time for Biden to step down, so I think he’s doing the right thing but I’m a little bit weary. I like Kamala Harris but I don't know if she's done anything that shows us she's presidential yet. We certainly haven't heard much about what she's done as vice president. I'm also not happy with what's going on with the border. I’m still waiting to see if they put up some other candidates to compete with her. I do like her, but I'm not sure if she's the one that's going to take us where we need to be as a country. I’m unaffiliated, so I don’t vote straight Democrat, but I definitely can’t vote for Trump based on what I’ve seen so far, and Project 2025 is terrifying.”"", '“We kind of saw it coming with all his stumbling around; seems like he’s close to senile anyway. I don’t think having Kamala Harris run could hurt (the Democrats) chances but it seems like they’re both different sides of the same coin. All the Democrats love women so I’m sure they’re going to eat that up, but I don’t know if everybody’s ready yet. I also don’t necessarily think it has to be a man or a woman, it should be whether they’re the right person for our country. It would be nice to have a woman but whether that should be Harris is hard to say considering how hard she was on crime in the beginning of her career and how hard she was on people.”', '“I’ve never met either personally, so I can only really conjecture based off what I’m shown by the media. But you can just see how they’re watering things down more and more, like look at Disney, with all the diverse characters now and everything like that at the cost of actual storytelling. It’s also taking place in politics, and Kamala Harris is the best example of that. It doesn’t need to be said but obviously this isn’t working, the two-party system is insane. It’s completely useless. Well, it’s not useless unless you want to create division and establish a culture of division like we have now.”', '“I feel like it’s kind of scary that it’s this close to the election. Maybe it will be hard for people to rally around her in the four short months that are left. I feel like Biden has honestly done a good job and she’s (Harris) been there alongside him but it’s just shaking things up too much with so little time left. ”', '“I think it was the right thing to do. As far as Harris coming in as the new nominee, well, nobody knows anything about her. She’s been in for four years and I’ve only heard her name a few times. One thing I do know about her is that she was in charge of the border wall and she did nothing, she didn’t even go down there. (Fact check: Harris visited the border in June 2021.) Hardcore Democrats are going to vote for her no matter what. But people on the fence? They don’t know enough about her and Trump gave such a great speech at the convention that I think was enough to swing people. Harris really could have been something. She was their (the Democrats) next superstar, but they didn’t groom her. These last four years they didn’t do anything with her.”', 'Choose from several print and digital subscription packages']"

', 'On Sunday, Shapiro released a statement praising Biden’s long career in politics. “President Biden is a patriot who has served our country honorably in the Senate, as Vice President, and as one of the most consequential presidents in modern history,” he said in a post to social media. “President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom.

I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States.”', 'A Shapiro spokesman confirmed that the governor spoke with Harris on Sunday.', 'Rising from a state House seat representing his hometown of Abington to the governor’s mansion, Shapiro built a reputation for being a hard worker and a skilled negotiator.

During his first tenure in Harrisburg, Shapiro demonstrated acumen for forging compromise. He helped to negotiate a play to put Rep. Denny O’Brien, a Republican backed by a reform-minded alliance of Democratic and GOP lawmakers, on the speaker’s rostrum in 2007.', 'In doing so, Shapiro helped knock Rep. John Perzel, a Philadelphia GOP boss later convicted of using state resources for campaigns, from the speaker’s seat. O’Brien named Shapiro a co-chair of the newly formed Speaker’s Committee on Reform.', 'After three terms in the House, Shapiro returned to Montgomery County, where he was elected to oversee a financially distressed government. According to his campaign biography, Shapiro erased a $10 million deficit and simplified the county’s investments to rescue its half-billion-dollar retirement fund.', 'It was as the state’s attorney general, however, that Shapiro began to draw national and international headlines. In 2018 he released the results of a grand jury investigation that alleged widespread abuse of 1,000 children by some 300 “predator priests” in six of Pennsylvania’s eight Roman Catholic dioceses. In a scathing report, Shapiro said church leaders engaged in a “systematic cover up” over the course of eight decades to protect the institution, transferring abusers from one parish to another without disclosing their prior acts. ', 'Shapiro opposed proposals by the dioceses to establish victims’ compensation funds, noting that the grand jury recommended lifting or creating exceptions to the criminal and civil statutes of limitations for abuse and saying that the church should not be “the arbiter of its own punishment.” While the legislature eliminated the criminal statute of limitations for abuse, it has been unable to complete legislation to allow older victims to sue their abusers and those who enabled them. Within a year of the report’s release, the dioceses paid $84 million to settle claims by 564 victims. ', 'And he sued former President Donald Trump’s administration some two dozen times, including in 2019, to challenge a “gag rule” imposing restrictions on participants in the Title X family planning program.', 'Shapiro also brokered a 2019 deal between two western Pennsylvania healthcare giants, UPMC and Highmark, who were at odds over terms to allow Highmark-insured patients to receive in-network care at UPMC facilities. Shapiro accused UPMC, the largest healthcare system in western Pennsylvania, of violating the state’s public charities law and of unfair trade practices. The two sides signed a 10-year agreement allowing patients to keep access to each other’s services just days before the previous agreement expired. ', 'Shapiro’s 2022 run for governor came the same cycle that Democrat John Fetterman ran for the state’s open Senate seat, in an election year when candidates aligned with Trump fared relatively poorly. The U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade just a few months prior, was galvanizing for many Democrats, and Shapiro’s Republican opponent, state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), was and is staunchly anti-abortion. ', 'Mastriano, a retired U.S. Army colonel from south-central Pennsylvania, ran on a far-right platform in which he advocated restricting abortion access and cutting public school funding. He also promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic. ', 'Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said Shapiro’s campaign zeroed in on Mastriano’s weaknesses early in the campaign and didn’t let up. He also received endorsements from more than a dozen high-profile Republicans including former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former Pennsylvania Congressmen Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood.', '“It was a textbook on campaigns that didn’t deviate from their game plan,” Borick said, adding that Shapiro is disciplined in his messaging and style. “He doesn’t make a lot of unforced errors in his politics.”', 'His tenure as governor has not been without controversy. The first budget Shapiro negotiated, with a GOP-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House, was delayed nearly six months, as a protracted battle over school vouchers simmered through the summer into the fall. Senate Republicans blamed Shapiro for failing to secure the support of House Democrats, who killed the $100 million program. ', 'Last August, Shapiro’s office paid $295,000 in public funds to settle a state employee’s sexual harassment complaint against his longtime aide and former Legislative Affairs Secretary Mike Vereb.

The governor has urged Democrats to follow his winning formula by focusing on the everyday concerns of Americans, from good-paying jobs to quality education and health care.', 'Beshear, 46, supports abortion rights, but in Kentucky, he has tailored his message to push back against what he calls an extreme ban that lacks exceptions for rape and incest victims.', 'He won widespread praise for his empathy and attention to detail in guiding the Bluegrass State through the COVID-19 pandemic and leading the response to tornadoes and flooding that caused massive damage. He honed his speaking skills by holding regular news conferences that often last an hour or so.', 'Beshear has presided over record economic growth in Kentucky, and he typically begins his briefings by promoting the state’s latest economic wins. He frequently mentions his Christian faith and how it guides his policymaking.', 'A lawyer by trade, Beshear won election as state attorney general in 2015. He then unseated Trump-backed Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019.', 'Beshear entered politics with a strong pedigree as the son of two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, but has faced tougher political obstacles.

He also portrays himself as a fighter for public education and abortion rights. While Cooper finally persuaded GOP legislators last year to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, other efforts have been thwarted by a General Assembly with veto-proof majorities that has eroded his formal powers.', 'A native of small-town Nash County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Raleigh, Cooper was a high school quarterback and head of the Young Democrats at the University of North Carolina, where he obtained both his undergraduate and law degrees. “Coop,” as he was known to friends, came home and worked at his father’s law firm.', 'What to know about the 2024 Election', 'Cooper upset the Democratic incumbent in a 1986 state House primary race and was elected to the General Assembly. He served 14 years there and later became the Senate majority leader.', 'Cooper was elected attorney general in 2000, a position he held for 16 years. In that post, he is likely best known nationally for declaring three former Duke University lacrosse players innocent after they were accused of sexual assault by an escort service dancer.', 'Cooper unseated another incumbent in 2016, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory by roughly 10,000 votes. A top campaign issue was the “bathroom bill” that McCrory signed requiring transgender people to use public restrooms that corresponded with the sex on their birth certificates. As governor, Cooper quickly reached an agreement with legislators to partially repeal the law.', 'His time as governor also was marked by restricting business and school activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

John McCain and the second two years later for a full term — Kelly has earned more votes than any other Democrat on the ballot. He outpolled Biden, who narrowly won Arizona, by 2 percentage points in 2020.', 'Kelly’s first turn in the national political spotlight came through tragedy. His wife, then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in the head while meeting with constituents outside a grocery store in Tucson. The shooting left six people dead and spawned an early reckoning with political violence and partisan rancor.', 'Giffords’ survival made her a national inspiration but snuffed out a promising political career of her own. She and Kelly went on to found a gun-control advocacy group, and Giffords has been a powerful surrogate as Kelly has taken her place in politics.', 'In the Senate, Kelly has focused on national security and the military as well as the drought plaguing the U.S. West. He was instrumental in crafting the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill signed by Biden to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.', 'Kelly was a Navy test pilot and flew 39 combat missions during the Gulf War before joining NASA, where he flew three missions on the space shuttle.', 'Originally from New Jersey, he settled with Giffords in Tucson after retiring from NASA and the Navy.', 'Unlike Arizona Sen.

That is Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR, who joins us from Rehoboth Beach with the pool of reporters covering President Biden."", 'Great to see you both.', ""So, Amy, you saw there Laura reported earlier on just the deluge of support from Democratic lawmakers lining up behind Vice President Harris. And a lot of the names who'd been previously floated as potential challengers, Governor Gavin Newsom of California, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have all endorsed her now."", 'Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Why do you think the party coalesced around her so quickly?', 'Amy Walter:', ""I think they realized that it was getting late very quickly. It's not Yogi Berra, it's getting late early, and that there's only three weeks until the convention. We only have four months until Election Day, and that they had spent three weeks basically wringing their hands after the June 27 debate about what to do about Joe Biden, watching their poll numbers really sink very deeply and downballot candidates really starting to get incredibly nervous about the impact of the top of the ticket on their own races."", 'So I think what they saw was that they needed to line up immediately behind a different candidate and put all their effort into making that work.', 'Amna Nawaz:', ""And, Tam, we have seen, she's hit the ground running. Vice President Harris visited the campaign headquarters earlier today, addressed the staff. That is now her team."", 'And she delivered this message about how she plans to take a powerful message directly to former President Trump. Take a listen.', ""Kamala Harris, Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate: Predators who abused women,fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type."", 'Amna Nawaz:', ""Tam, there is the taking on Donald Trump part of this, and there's also the potentially shoring up parts of the voting blocs where President Biden had been weak. What's the Harris strategy there? Can she do that?"", 'Already, young voters are more excited than they were before. She is a very memeable candidate, and her videos are all over TikTok, and young people are excited.', ""You're seeing — and I will be honest, I can't fully explain it, but you are seeing coconut emojis all over the place because of something she said a year ago that has become a meme."", 'So she is bringing new life to this campaign for Democrats. As we have talked about many times before, and even before that very bad debate that President Biden had, Democrats had an unease with him. There were worries that he was too old. Democrats told pollsters. They said it in focus groups. They said that they hoped that the party would have another candidate.', ""I don't think many people imagined that it would happen exactly this way, but this is what has happened. President Biden had said he is a big believer in fate. Fate intervened with that debate, and then the three weeks of just growing concern and anxiety among Democrats."", ""And you saw it with the fund-raising; $81 million in the first 24 hours, that is record-breaking fund-raising coming from small-dollar donors. These are people — 60 percent of them were new, according to the campaign. These were people who had been holding back, who weren't excited, and there was some sort of a pent-up demand among Democrats to show that excitement."", ""She's also certainly reaching out to African American voters, the Divine Nine Black sororities and fraternities. There is a well of energy that exists for Harris and who she is and the history she could make. Of course, Republicans also want to tap into that and paint her as extreme."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'So, Amy, from what we know about why voters had been backing away from the Biden/Harris campaign in the last several months, the donor support is one thing, party officials and lawmakers lining up behind her is another.', 'Does all of that translate to the polls? Do we know?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Well, that is a question.', 'And so just to get a little bit wonky for one second, but — I think we have to be careful not to look at polls taken before Sunday as indicative of where Kamala Harris is in terms of her matchup with Donald Trump or even how people feel about her.', 'Now, they may have answered polls in which they said, when asked, what do you think about Kamala Harris being the president or running up against…', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'These are hypothetical matchups, right?', 'Amy Walter:', ""But they're hypothetical. In the same way that I could ask you about something theoretical about like a meal you're going to have, but until you actually have it, you can't really tell me what the experience was."", ""So I think it's going to be an interesting few weeks as people start to digest this. And you're right. I think, at minimum, what it does, though, it does energize both the donor base and voter base that has been sort of depressed, for lack of a better term. So what this does is, it helps to raise her floor, in other words."", ""Like, if she gets the base back, that's really good news if you are the Harris campaign. The challenge is going to be getting those swing voters onto her side. And that — we don't know yet how they are going to react either to her, the way she came into this position, and the fact, remember, she brings — she does bring some energy to the Democratic base, but she carries all the same baggage because, as we will hear from Republicans, she was principally sourced to work on the border."", ""She is in the White House when a whole bunch of other stuff passed, including the Inflation Reduction Act and others that they are no doubt going to remind voters that she can't separate herself from the actions of the administration as a whole."", 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Well, Tam, to that point, we have already seen Republicans working very hard to link her to President Biden, to what they call his failed policies.', ""And if you look at the Republican play, naming J.D. Vance to the ticket was really a doubling down on the base, right? And it's a straight play for that blue wall, those four states he kept mentioning over and over again of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio at the Republican National Convention."", 'In the world of potential running mates for a possible Vice — a possible President Harris nomination here, nominee here, where do Dems have the most potential advantage? Who could help her out most, if needed, against these Republican — this Republican ticket?', 'Tamara Keith:', ""Well, there are some swing state Democratic governors who could certainly help, the governor of Pennsylvania, for instance, or the governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, who is someone who is actually quite popular in a swing state, if you're being generous."", ""Generally, it's been a Republican state, but he's a Democrat who has won twice with Trump on the ballot. That is a state that has been a reach for Democrats and is something they could be looking for."", ""But I also want to just, like, be realistic about how important the vice presidential pick is. We all love to talk about it. Veepstakes are extremely fun. And it's great to play those games and think about scenarios."", 'But, in the end, the president — the nominee is running for president. The vice presidential nominee can only do so much. They can do harm, but they can only help so much.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Amy, you agree with that?', 'Amy Walter:', 'Absolutely. I mean, it helps around the margins.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Amy Walter:', ""But in an era where everything is decided by the margins, I think that's important."", ""There's also the question about sending a message, not just about the candidate, who they are, where they're from, but what their age is, what their background is. It would be a generational shift to pick somebody like Josh Shapiro, who's in his late 40s, and having Kamala Harris. It would also sort of make a Gen X argument for the Democrats, versus a baby boom presidential candidate on the Republican side."", 'Amna Nawaz:', ""I realize there's still, Amy, some questions ahead. Obviously, Democrats have to work out the rules for the infrastructure moving forward with the nominating process, but you noted as we began this conversation, it was three weeks ago that debate unfolded that led to this whirlwind of activity we have seen in the last few weeks."", 'And we have basically that exact same time to go before the Democratic Convention begins.', 'Amy Walter:', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Is the chaos portion of this election cycle over, or is there greater uncertainty ahead?', 'Amy Walter:', ""Yes, I'm never going to say anything's over now."", '(Laughter)', 'Amy Walter:', 'I think we should feel pretty good about that.', ""But I do think we have to — as Tam pointed out, and Laura, the campaign infrastructure itself seems to be settling into place. Basically, they're conveying the Biden campaign to the Harris campaign, but that's going to be an integration that's going to take a little bit of time. I'm sure there are going to be some bumps along the way there."", ""And then Harris has to go out and perform as a candidate. She hasn't had to do that as a candidate since she was on the — well, not even on the trail in 2020, when they were sort of campaigning remotely, and then before that in her failed bid for the nomination."", 'So this is a very different experience that she is going to have to get up to speed on.', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Different experience for all of us to cover as well.', 'Amy Walter:', 'Tamara Keith:', 'Amna Nawaz:', 'Tam, very quickly, a couple seconds left.

In October 2023, Harris sat down with PEOPLE at her home, the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., for a wide-ranging interview. From her marriage to (the first) Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, to her favorite Beyoncé song to her vision for the future, read the full interview below.', 'Kamala Harris is vice president “24/7, 365” as her husband of nine years, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, puts it. But on her 59th birthday on Oct. 20, she was planning on a slightly more relaxed day than usual: after a morning interview and photo shoot with PEOPLE, perhaps a few moments in her vegetable garden — where she likes to pick fresh tarragon for salads — followed by a small gathering with family and close friends. An early summons from the president to report to the Oval Office amid the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza meant that Harris was thrust into action, with her staff scrambling to rearrange her day.', 'Of course, for the highest-ranking woman in U.S. history, birthdays — along with nearly everything else — are a distant second to the job.', 'At the end of each evening, after reading her nightly “binders” of briefing documents (“about this thick,” she explains, placing her hands a foot apart), Harris says she tries to have some “wind-down time.” Still, she admits that the brief respite and a mug of chamomile tea aren’t quite enough.', '“I usually wake up in the middle of the night with some thought of what’s going on,” she says. “Then I fall back asleep, and the next day starts.”', 'YSA PEREZ', 'Restless nights, hurried days, intense pressure: Welcome to Kamala Harris’ world, in which the triple landmark of being the first woman, first Black person and first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president carries an unprecedented combination of scrutiny and expectation.', 'Nearly three years into a role that is notoriously diffuse — “I am vice president. In this I am nothing, but I may be everything,” John Adams famously said — the woman who is a heartbeat away from the most powerful job in the world is determined to take things one day at a time.', 'She is well aware that in a hyperpolarized political culture, the “comments section” of her life draws both praise and vitriol. The latter, which often veers into racism and sexism, is something Harris has navigated throughout her lifelong career in public service. ', '“The strategy is focusing on the people who are there to support you rather than giving your energy to those who may not be,” she says of her approach to managing negativity. “It’s important to have people in your life who will applaud your ambition.” But she is quick to note that included in that group are “people who are very candid with you. Who are going to say to you, ‘Honey, you need a mint.’ ‘You have food in your teeth.’ Right?”', 'ADAM SCHULTZ/OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE PHOTO', 'Harris’ critics, of course, don’t hesitate to point out her perceived slip-ups, from her meme-able “word salads” to deep frustrations with what many see as a lack of impact during her current term.', 'After making history with Joe Biden in 2020 — “We did it, Joe,” she effused in a viral video declaring their winning moment — Harris has seen her favorability rating dip to 39%, slightly less than both Biden and her predecessor Mike Pence, according to recent polling by the Los Angeles Times.', 'Although she has crisscrossed the country, most recently drawing more than 10,000 Gen Z students on her “Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour” (her favorability among Gen Z holds at almost 60%), she has been accused of low visibility among even her supporters.', 'She has also been tasked with leading the administration’s public stance on immigration, sparking dissent from all sides. At the final stop of her tour at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, a student confronted Harris about “this country’s inhumane [immigration] policies,” drawing a comparison to the treatment of Palestinians and sparking loud applause from the young crowd.

Love you too. Have a great day.’ But to the extent we’re able to have that connection at night, it’s really couple time: time talking about kids, family and very little about the workings of our days.”', 'Harris’ favorite title is “Momala” to stepkids Cole, 29, and Ella, 24. “It’s the name the kids gave me, and I wear it proudly.” She finds the most peace, she adds, with her family.', '“I am my happiest self when generations in my family are getting together and I’m cooking,” she says. “Recently for the wedding weekend, my baby nieces, my husband gets up early and does his coffee and whatever, and they just came running in my room and then jumped in bed with me, and we just talked and laughed.”', 'For now, that cherished downtime is rare. International turmoil continues to shake the globe, the 2024 campaign trail is just around the corner, and millions of Americans on both sides of the political aisle continue to feel frustrated with a variety of issues.', 'But Harris is unbowed. Sharing that she attended Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour this summer, she says her favorite song is “Break My Soul.”', '“I just love that song,” she says. “I play it all the time. I think it’s one of the anthems for women . . . when [Beyoncé says] ‘you,’ you could be life, you could be a person, you could be a situation. You will not break my soul. I can endure.”']"

On July 13, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt two days before the start of the Republican National Convention. Then yesterday, President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race, an unprecedented move for a sitting president who was his party's presumptive nominee."", ""Biden's exit follows more than three weeks of growing calls among Democratic Party officials, donors and voters for him to consider stepping aside following his woeful performance in the June 27 debate against Trump. His decision leaves a vacant presidential nomination slot for Democrats less than a month before the party gathers in Chicago for its national convention. Yet Biden and many other high-profile Democrats have lined up behind Vice President Kamala Harris, making her unquestionably the most likely post-Biden alternative."", ""Naturally, we wondered how much better or worse Harris has polled against Trump compared with Biden. To get an initial apples-to-apples comparison, we homed in on national- and state-level surveys that separately tested both Harris and Biden against Trump. We also split the polls by whether the pollster conducted the survey before the debate (going back to Jan. 1) or after it, which gave us 24 pre-debate polls and 46 post-debate polls. While Harris consistently polled worse than Biden did against Trump before the debate, since then she's sometimes polled ahead of Biden. In fact, Harris fared the same as or better than Biden in close to half of the post-debate polls: A near-bell curve distribution in the differences between their margins in these polls is centered close to 0, suggesting little to no meaningful difference between how Harris and Biden performed."", ""And it seems that Harris's stronger showing in these later polls is more about her having made up distance on Trump than Biden losing ground. Across nine national surveys before the debate, Harris did about 3 points worse than Biden on average, but in 25 post-debate polls, she's only performed about 1 point worse than Biden on average — even as Biden's margin in the same set of post-debate surveys also got slightly better.* Harris also improved her showing across the swing states, based on a very limited sampling of polls."", ""To be clear, this doesn't mean that Harris will run notably stronger than Biden, only that she could. Her post-debate polls against Trump relative to Biden have a great deal of variance, ranging from around 8 points worse to 4 points better than how Biden performed. Based on an average of 26 national polls conducted over the past month, Harris trailed Trump by 4.5 points nationally compared with a smaller 3-point deficit for Biden."", ""Polling at the state level is limited at this point, with no more than four polls conducted in the past month in any battleground state. But based on the state-level polls we do have, things don't look any more rosy for Harris there, as she lags behind Biden's margin against Trump in the key battleground states for which we have data. In our aggregate of this limited set of polls, Harris trailed Trump by around 3 points in Wisconsin (Biden trailed by about 2 points), by almost 5 in Pennsylvania (Biden was down around 4) and by 5 in Michigan (Biden was behind by about 2). This raises the possibility that she could have a harder time than Biden winning the Electoral College and thus the election."", ""Still, if Harris does end up as her party's nominee, Democrats will hope that her polling improves as she mounts an active campaign against Trump. For one thing, Harris could experience something of a quasi-convention bounce in the wake of the coverage of Biden's departure and her now-active candidacy. Moreover, until Sunday, any poll that tested Harris (or any other possible Democratic candidate) had been hypothetical for survey respondents. That is not the case anymore, which could at least partially reset the race and shift how some voters are thinking about it moving forward. For Democrats, Harris could represent an escape hatch from the doom spiral of negative media coverage that had hounded Biden following the June debate, as well as the heightened concerns about his capacity to serve at 81 years old and fears that he could not recover the momentum against Trump."", ""Ultimately, Harris's seeming upward trend in the polls and the fact that she's polled better than Biden in many recent surveys will give Democrats reason to hope that she has a higher ceiling of support than the president, whose polling numbers had remained pretty stagnant throughout the campaign. This seems especially true because fewer Americans have expressed an opinion about Harris than Biden in approval polling. In theory then, the public has less concrete views about the vice president, which could allow her to win over some voters who didn't want to consider Biden."", 'Of course, that hypothesis needs to be tested on the proving ground of the campaign trail. If nominated, Harris could absolutely end up losing to Trump — after all, the same post-debate polling that suggested she could do better than Biden also pointed to a potentially lower floor of support. But for Democrats who felt like they were slouching toward defeat in November behind a candidate whom voters were increasingly unenthused by, a Biden alternative could shake up the race, excite the party and give Democrats a chance of rebuilding an anti-Trump coalition that could win.', ""*To reiterate the limitations of this analysis, we know that Biden's margin against Trump actually got slightly worse in 538's national polling average right before he dropped out. The post-debate polls that tested both Harris and Biden constitute only about one-third of all state and national polls that asked about the general election in the post-debate time frame.""]"

The most formidable challenge – defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November – is still to come. Her elevation to the top of ticket would bring new strengths for the Democrats, but it also exposes weaknesses that were less of a concern with Mr Biden.', 'According to recent polls, Ms Harris trails the former president slightly – a roughly similar position to the one Mr Biden found himself in before his historic announcement. But there may be more room for those numbers to shift as we move from a hypothetical matchup to a very real one.', 'For at least a moment, Democrats have a jolt of energy after more than three weeks of intense hand-wringing over the president’s fitness and ability to sustain his campaign.', 'All of Ms Harris’s leading potential rivals for the nomination have endorsed her, as has former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi – who remains one of the most influential players in Democratic politics.', 'This is, still, shaping up to be a tight race in November - a condition that reflects deep partisan trenches in American politics and the distaste many voters have for Trump as a candidate.', 'The vice-president’s primary challenge – and opportunity - will be to capitalise on this Trump aversion, attract centrist voters in key swing states and energise the Democratic base, which was in the past few weeks swinging towards despair, to match the enthusiasm many on the right hold for the former president.', 'This renewed sense of Democratic presidential enthusiasm comes with a dollar sign attached. According to the Harris campaign, the vice-president raised more than $80m (£62m) in new donations in the 24 hours since Mr Biden’s announcement – the biggest one-day total of any candidate this election cycle. That, along with the nearly $100m she inherits from the Biden-Harris fundraising coffers, gives her a firm financial footing for the campaign to come.', 'Ms Harris, if she becomes the nominee, also defuses one of the most effective attacks the Republicans have levelled against their opponent: his age.', 'For months, the Trump campaign has been pounding Mr Biden for being feeble and easily confused – characterisations that were reinforced for many Americans after the president’s halting debate performance four weeks ago.', 'The vice-president, at age 59, will be a more energetic campaigner and able to make a more coherent case for her party. She could also turn the 78-year-old Trump’s age against him, as he would become the oldest person ever elected president.', 'Ms Harris may also be able to shore up support from black voters, who polls indicate had been drifting away from Mr Biden in recent months. If she can combine that with more backing from other minorities and younger voters – Barack Obama’s winning coalition from 2008 and 2012 – it could help her gain ground against Trump in the handful of swing states that will decide this year’s election.', 'Her background as a prosecutor could also burnish tough-on-crime credentials. While her law-enforcement resume was a liability when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 – and led to derisive “Kamala is a cop” attacks from the left – it could help her in a campaign against Trump.', 'The vice-president has also been the administration’s point person on abortion, which has proven to be one of the most potent issues for motivating the Democratic base in recent elections. Mr Biden, by contrast, sometimes had been a reluctant advocate on the issue, hampered by a past record of supporting some limits on the procedure.', ""“I think she reminds suburban women across the country, particularly in those battleground states, of what's at stake with reproductive rights,” former New York congressman Steve Israel, who headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told the BBC’s Americast podcast."", '""We have established a fundamental reset in the campaign.”', 'For all Harris’s potential strengths, there is a reason why some Democrats were initially reluctant to push Mr Biden to step aside, given that his running mate would be the clear successor.', ""Despite generating Democratic enthusiasm on the subject of abortion, Ms Harris's record as vice-president has been mixed. Early in the administration, she was set the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border. A number of missteps and misstatements - including a ham-handed June 2021 interview with NBC News presenter Lester Holt – damaged her standing and opened her to conservative attacks."", ""Republicans are already condemning her as the president’s “border czar”, attempting to make her the face of what public opinion polls have found is the Biden administration's unpopular immigration policies."", '“Immigration is a soft spot for Democrats in those battleground areas,” Mr Israel said. “This is a very salient issue for voters living in those suburbs, fairly or unfairly. They believe that our immigration system is not managed strongly enough.”', 'The Trump campaign will also try to turn the vice-president’s prosecutorial background against her – both by highlighting the former president’s record of enacting criminal justice reform and by attacking her past prosecutorial and parole decisions.', 'Another Harris vulnerability is her chequered track record as a candidate. In her 2016 Senate bid, she faced only token opposition from Republicans in deeply Democratic California.', 'Her one solo run for national office – a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination – ended in ruins. While she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primary contests.', 'Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ms Harris is that, unlike the president, she is not the incumbent. While she might have the opportunity to distance herself from some of the more unpopular elements of Mr Biden’s record, she also does not have the luxury of being a known quantity for voters.', 'Expect a furious effort by Republicans to paint Ms Harris as too untested and too risky to be president. In effect, Trump now has a greater claim to being the only proven commodity.', 'The vice-president has a chance, in the days ahead, to make a new first impression with the American public. If she stumbles out of the gate, it could open the door to an extended power struggle that stretches into the Democrat’s national convention in late August. They could end up with the party uniting behind a different candidate – or tearing itself apart.', 'As the past four weeks have shown, fortunes in the White House race can shift quickly and permanently. Ms Harris has punched her ticket to the biggest stage in American politics – now she has to show she can compete.', 'Both parties called on Kimberly Cheatle to resign during a bruising hearing about security lapses that led to the Trump rally shooting.', ""Liberal voters - and one Republican sceptical of Trump - react to Biden's decision to endorse Harris."", 'It’s not a done deal but some potential rivals have quickly thrown their support behind her.', 'The path for a Democratic nominee is less than clear months before the election.', ""The US Vice-President praised Joe Biden's track record as US president.""]"

For the most part, Democrats in leading positions have been quick to follow the president’s lead and circle the wagons around his heir apparent.', 'Other leading figures, though, wary of appearing as if they were “coronating” Harris, kept their powder dry.', 'Former President Bill Clinton and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, in a joint statement, said that they were “honored” to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.”', '“Now is the time,” the Clintons added, “to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her. America’s future depends on it.”', 'Leaders of nearly all House Democrats’ power centers lined up behind Harris. Rep. Annie Kuster, chair of the vast, moderate New Democrat caucus, gave Harris her “full-throated endorsement.” Further to the left, Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal said she looked forward to Harris becoming “the first South Asian American and first Black woman to serve as President of the United States of America.” Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Nanette Barragán endorsed Harris, as did the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus, which had been one of the last bulwarks of support for Biden since the disastrous June presidential debate.', 'Rank-and-file members and senators across the board, from Sens. Mark Warner and Chris Coons to Reps. Ilhan Omar and Jamaal Bowman, were falling in line at a rapid clip throughout Sunday afternoon.', 'You’ll notice some other major Democratic names, though, missing from this list. And there’s something that they all have in common.', 'Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said in her statement, “President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history.', '“God blessed America,” she added, “with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”', 'Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was similarly reverential, saying, “America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace, and dignity. We are forever grateful.”', 'And Biden’s old boss, former President Barack Obama, paid his respects by writing an article-length statement rather than a couple of nice sentences. In regard to the path forward, Obama said, he had “extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges. I believe that Joe Biden’s vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August.”', 'What do these four—who did not explicitly endorse Harris—have in common? Well, they’re all at severe risk of being dropped from Biden’s Christmas card list this year, as these were the four leaders who appeared to do the most work behind the scenes to nudge Biden out of the race.', 'Since they are already facing some backlash from the minority of Democrats who wanted Biden to stay on, they don’t want to appear as if they’re also determining the next party nominee. As Politico reported recently, Pelosi was among those in a recent discussion who stressed “the potential political downsides of party elites quickly crowning the vice president as the next nominee.”', 'Harris also recognizes that there would be political downsides to coronating herself. In her statement Sunday, she said she was “honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” In other words, she is not accepting the nomination right now.', '“Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,” Harris added. “And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.”', 'So is Harris’ nomination a lock? What of the fabled miniprimary?', 'It’s worth at least parsing statements from arguably the two other would-be top rivals to Harris for the nomination: California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.', 'Whitmer posted a statement that read: “My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.” And Newsom, in a brief post, said that Biden “will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents.” [Update, July 21, 2024, at 8:11 p.m.: Newsom released another statement later in the day that said, “No one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President, Kamala Harris.”]', 'Neither of those statements endorses Harris. And neither Whitmer nor Newsom has shut the door to their own presidential hopes this cycle either. (Another Bloomberg report said that Whitmer did not “intend” to challenge Harris for the nomination this cycle. Well, I didn’t “intend” to be working on a Sunday afternoon, but here we are.)

She did run a bad race. There are a couple of lessons to be learned from it. For starters, she should make sure her best debate zinger—aimed, remember, at Joe Biden—is not a defense of a deeply unpopular 50-year-old policy (busing) that, a few days after the debate, her aides could not defend. So there’s that.', 'However, I’d argue today that that race is largely irrelevant to this one, assuming she’s the candidate (which I’ll discuss a bit below, but which I do believe we can assume). There are a couple of key reasons why.', 'First of all, she doesn’t have to build this campaign from the ground up. The Biden campaign has a staff of thousands in place. Some of them won’t want to work for Harris, but I’d imagine most of them will. Granted, she’ll need to bring in her top people, and that’s an important job. But she won’t have to hire, say, a whole fundraising staff. She won’t have to execute contracts with vendors. All that’s done, and I hope we can presume that the people in those jobs are experienced and reasonably competent.', 'And second, and actually more important, this is not a primary against 17 like-minded people where you have to strain to stand out. That was a marathon where it was hard to get attention. This is a sprint where the attention is going to be automatic and intense. To the extent that she isn’t now, she’ll be nationally known in a matter of days, and assuming the polls are correct and Harris is as close to Donald Trump as Joe Biden was (or even closer), she already has 75 million votes in her pocket. She just needs to win those final seven or eight million.', 'So no: She’s not one of 100 senators scrambling to generate buzz in a crowded primary field. She’s the likely Democratic Party standard-bearer. And two other things: She’s not 81, and she’s not Trump. For a lot of people, that’s all she needs to be.', 'But not, of course, for everyone. Here there are two main groups of concern. The first, I wrote about last week: the Biden diehards who wanted the president to stay in the race. They were as of last week an angry bunch, and they’re probably angrier still this week. It will be largely up to Biden to calm them down and tell them to follow his example and do what’s right for the country here. But it will also be the job of all the leading Democrats to lavish praise on Biden and turn this moment—which, let’s face it, holds great potential for chaos and disarray—into a moment when the party finds a surprising and extraordinary unity.', 'The next group consists of those who want an open primary process. That includes me, at least in my dream world—one in which Biden had made his decision in time for a six-week mini-primary before the convention, which starts on August 19. But Biden demurred, and now it’s too late for that.', 'And Biden has endorsed Harris. Can anyone else still get in? Sure, of course. And maybe some will. There may be statement candidacies of some sort from both the center and the left. But it’s unlikely that any of the big governors are going to jump in. So the open-process devotees are just going to have to come to terms with this. It’s going to be Harris.', 'It’s going to be Harris, and it’s going to have to be a galvanized and unified effort like none we’ve ever seen. I have my reservations about her. So do you. So do we all. She has pretty high negatives. She might prove to be a bad campaigner. She doesn’t, as I’ve written, appear to have a natural passion for economic policy. I could go on.', 'But we just need to wrap our heads around this right now. It seems 90 percent likely that she’s going to be the Democratic nominee. And the Democrats need to embrace it and line up and move heaven and earth to make her a winner.', 'And the man who can be the Leonard Bernstein of that orchestra is of course the man who just became the second American Cincinnatus. Joe Biden stepped forward to save the country from Trump in 2020, and now, in 2024, he steps back, willingly giving up power, to save the country from Trump again. Tuesday at the Democratic convention had better be Joe Biden Day, and they better put on the show that the man deserves. His decision Sunday will go down in American history, and if Harris (or a different Democrat) ends up winning in November, it’ll be worthy of a painting in the Capitol Rotunda someday. Perhaps unveiled by the first Black woman president.

In one term, he has already …,” Harris said in a speech on the White House South Lawn, before stopping mid-sentence to add, “Yes, you may clap.”', 'Harris delivered her trademark laugh — often described by detractors as a cackle — while pausing at the event honoring the men’s and women’s NCAA championship teams.', 'The vice president spoke to the teams in Biden’s absence as he recovers from COVID-19 at his Delaware vacation home, from which he tweeted Sunday afternoon that he would retire and back Harris for the Democratic nomination.', '“Our president, Joe Biden, wanted to be here today. He is feeling much better and recovering fast, and he looks forward to getting back on the road,” Harris, 59, told the student athletes — before launching into a political eulogy for her boss.', '“In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,” she said.', '“I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We worked together as attorneys general in our states, and back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is. The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president: his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big heart and his love, deep love of our country.”', 'Harris added: “I am firsthand witness that every day our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”', 'Many fellow Democrats rallied around Harris shortly after Biden endorsed her, but some party leaders did not immediately bless her as the would-be nominee against former President Donald Trump — including former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).', 'Harris faces an early test of support in early August when Democrats are set to electronically vote for the party’s nominee to meet an Aug. 7 Ohio ballot access deadline.

372,Harris isn’t her party’s best candidate. Biden was still right to endorse her.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvMzYyMDMzL2JpZGVuLWRyb3Atb3V0LWVuZG9yc2UtaGFycmlzLW9wZW4tY29udmVudGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"['Vox needs your help to cover the 2024 election and ensure that our readers have access to timely and reliable information.', 'The best option isn’t always a great one.', 'President Joe Biden just relinquished his claim on the Democratic nomination and handed it to Vice President Kamala Harris.', 'Since his disastrous debate performance last month, it has been clear that Biden could best prevent Donald Trump from retaking power by withdrawing from the presidential race. More than 70 percent of voters consider Biden unfit to seek another term in office. His poll numbers in swing states have fallen sharply in recent weeks, while the Democrats’ internal data has shown Trump only narrowly trailing in blue states such as Minnesota, New Mexico, and New Jersey.', 'Plenty of candidates in American history have closed larger polling gaps than Biden’s in a campaign’s last four months. But in recent weeks, the president repeatedly demonstrated a gross inability to effectively communicate, with each public performance generating multiple misstatements or brain freezes that reinforced the public’s doubts about his cognitive functioning.', 'Biden was undoubtedly right to step aside, but the wisdom of his decision to immediately endorse Harris — rather than clearing the way for a more open competition for the nomination at next month’s convention — is less clear.', 'After all, the vice president has many liabilities as a candidate, and the Democrats boast multiple popular swing-state governors whose hypothetical nomination might ease the party’s path to an Electoral College majority. Given the stakes of keeping Trump out of power, Democratic convention delegates may have been justified in picking whichever ticket seemed most likely to bring victory in November.', 'Nevertheless, I think Biden made the right call. If there were some mechanism for instantly achieving party unity around nominating Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — or one of the party’s other top-tier talents — then Democrats would be wise to take it. But no such mechanism exists.', 'Failing to rally around Harris would have left Democrats bereft of a nominee until late August, giving Trump a month to campaign unopposed. And the vice president would have been highly likely to prevail at that convention anyway, given her official status as Biden’s heir apparent and the democratic legitimacy that comes with it.', 'At this point, it is unlikely that the most promising candidates on the Democratic bench would have chosen to compete, given the risks of alienating key constituencies within the party and the widespread sense that Republicans will be favored to win in November, irrespective of whom the Democrats nominate.', 'Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term. And he made another by refusing to bow out swiftly once the debate made his unfitness plain. But on Sunday, he did the best he could to reverse some of the damage. It’s now incumbent on Harris — and all other Democrats — to put together a campaign strong enough to reverse the rest.', 'Before examining why endorsing Harris was (probably) the right call, it’s worth taking stock of the case for an open convention.', 'That argument boils down to three fundamental claims: 1) Harris is not an especially strong candidate, 2) nominating the vice president prevents Democrats from getting a clean break from Biden’s vulnerabilities, and 3) the party has several strong alternative candidates.', 'All these claims seem right to me.', 'Harris currently has a net disapproval rating of roughly negative 12 percent. And her electoral track record is unimpressive. In her first statewide election in 2010, Harris beat a Republican in the race for California attorney general by less than 1 percentage point (two years earlier, Barack Obama had bested John McCain by more than 23 points in that state). In 2020, Harris began her run for the Democratic nomination with strong fundraising and an early surge in the polls. Yet her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.', 'Further, as a Californian whose Senate voting record put her on the left wing of her caucus, Harris is not an ideal figurehead for a party anxious to appeal to Trump-curious Midwesterners.', 'Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.', 'Making matters worse, Harris’s candidacy did not fall out of a coconut tree. It exists in the context of her current boss’s unpopularity and conspicuous cognitive decline. For many voters, Biden has become a byword for inflation and infirmity. A Democratic nominee with no connection to the Biden administration would have given the party distance from both of these liabilities: They would have faced much less of a compulsion to defend Biden’s record, while confronting few questions about their own hypothetical complicity in concealing the president’s frailty.', 'On both these fronts, Harris could find herself saddled with her boss’s baggage.', 'Finally, the Democrats have some formidable politicians on their bench. Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer both boast majority approval in their critical swing states.', 'Democrats would likely be better off with one of those governors as their standard-bearer, all else being equal. But this does not mean that the party would have been better off holding a completely open convention.', 'The problems with withholding endorsements from Harris and pursuing an open convention are threefold.', 'First, the Democratic Party is poorly positioned to organize and legitimize a contested convention. It has been more than half a century since the Democrats chose a nominee through convention wrangling, rather than purely through the primary process. In that time, the institutional structure of the party has dramatically changed.', 'In the mid-20th century, Democratic delegates consisted in no small part of the leaders of trade unions and urban machines — individuals who were directly accountable to mass constituencies. This made it possible for them to credibly speak on behalf of key Democratic voting blocs.', 'Meanwhile, since contested conventions were routine occurrences in American politics at that time, there was a great deal of institutional knowledge about how to broker such competitions and reach consensus.', 'Today, by contrast, Democratic delegates are largely volunteers who speak for no one beyond the primary voters in their areas. In this context, a contested convention could be chaotic, and its nominee lacking in democratic legitimacy.', 'To be sure, anointing Harris is not especially democratic either. She was not elected by primary voters, any more than any other non-Biden Democrat. But the US electorate did vote to make her the president’s heir apparent, and this gives her a source of legitimacy that any other selection would lack.', 'Second, and more importantly, failing to coalesce behind a nominee today would have left Democrats without a standard-bearer for a month. This would inhibit fundraising, at a time when the Trump-Vance ticket is taking in serious cash. And it would mean ceding swing-state airwaves to the Republican message — or else, running exclusively negative advertising — for the next four weeks. This is especially risky in a context where Democrats face the challenge of introducing a new nominee to the country.', 'As Biden’s default replacement, having been elected to fill in for him in the event of his death or disability, Harris was uniquely capable of becoming her party’s consensus nominee in the absence of a protracted process.', 'Finally, Harris would have been highly likely to win an open convention, anyway. Before Biden dropped out, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn — a highly influential member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) — let it be known that he would favor Harris were Biden to drop out.', 'Due to her uniquely high name recognition, meanwhile, Harris would likely outperform any other individual Democratic candidate in opinion polls. And as such polls, in combination with her title, rendered her the frontrunner for the nomination, various Democratic interest groups would have had an incentive to line up behind her, so as to ensure their influence in the likely Democratic nominee’s hypothetical administration.', 'Assuming that congressional caucuses, Democratic interest groups, and poll respondents did indeed all indicate their preference for Harris, Democratic delegates would almost certainly have felt compelled to back her.', 'Most critically, it seems unlikely that Shapiro, Whitmer, or other top-tier Democratic talents would have entered the fray in any case. For the reasons already stated, any non-Harris candidate would have faced an uphill battle for the nomination. And merely trying to win that nod would have come at the cost of potentially alienating constituencies that they would need to win during a future primary: A white candidate hoping to one day compete in the South Carolina primary might be wise to avoid being the person who tried and failed to block the first African-American vice president from claiming a nomination that was hers to inherit, at least from the perspective of some Black Democratic elected officials.', 'What’s more, even if the gamble of challenging Harris paid off initially, the prize would ultimately have been the mixed-blessing of serving as the Democratic nominee in a year when the Republican ticket is favored. We cannot know exactly how polls and betting markets would have shifted had Democrats endorsed Shapiro or Whitmer. But Republicans have long held an advantage over Democrats this cycle on the issues most important to voters, chief of all inflation and immigration.', 'Given the balance of risks and benefits here, an ambitious and promising younger Democrat might prefer to sit back and position themselves for 2028 or 2032. At the very least, no swing-state Democrat let word of their interest in potentially running leak in the weeks since Biden’s bad debate.', 'Finally, although Harris has weaknesses, she is not devoid of political gifts. At 59, she is young by the standards of American politics. She is an able speaker, whose recent appearances have brimmed with more vitality and coherence than either Biden or Trump have mustered in years. Her recent remarks debunking the GOP’s claims of being the party of “unity” were especially effective.', 'Harris does have a negative approval rating. But it is nevertheless better than Biden’s. And the public’s disapproval of her is less strongly held. As the political consultant Sarah Longwell has reported, voters in focus groups tend to have a negative impression of Harris — but it is just that, an impression, rather than a deep-seated evaluation. They do not know much about her and are aware of that fact.', 'Today, Harris’s political brand is essentially indistinguishable from Biden’s. Many of her detractors may therefore be simply giving pollsters their views of the president. Those who are actually familiar with Harris, meanwhile, may see her through the lens of her 2020 primary campaign, during which she joined many other Democratic candidates in a bidding war for the allegiance of the party’s left wing. Now that she has been vaulted directly into the general election, Harris has the opportunity to reintroduce herself to the public in a manner tailored to the sensibilities of swing voters by, among other things, leaning into her experience as a “smart on crime” prosecutor.', 'Thus, if she can nail her campaign’s rollout, it is possible that Harris would see her numbers significantly improve.', 'Put all of this together and the case for uniting around Kamala is clear: Democrats can line up behind Biden’s logical successor today, put an end to their party’s internal chaos, and begin the work of rehabilitating Harris’s image — or they can pursue a path that likely ends with the same outcome, only after a month of internal disorganization, discord, and subpar fundraising.', 'The former isn’t a perfect option, but it was probably the best decision available to the Democrats at this late date. Joe Biden deserves credit for making it.', 'YOU’VE READ 1 ARTICLE IN THE LAST MONTH', 'Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

', 'On Monday, she stepped into a new spotlight as the presumptive Democratic nominee following President Joe Biden’s announcement Sunday that he would be dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsing Harris. ', 'At a White House event honoring college athletes on the South Lawn, Harris began her remarks by praising Biden, who is recovering from COVID-19 in Delaware, and did not acknowledge her new presidential campaign. ', '“Joe Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history,” she said. “In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office.”', 'Harris discussed knowing Beau Biden, Joe Biden’s eldest son who died of cancer in 2015, when they served as attorneys general of California and Delaware, respectively. ', '“The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president — his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big heart and his love, deep love of our country,” Harris said. “And I am firsthand witness that every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”', 'After Biden’s announcement he would drop out Sunday, Harris issued a statement saying she intends “to earn and win the nomination” to be the Democratic Party’s official candidate for president. Should she do so, she would be the first Black and the first South Asian woman to secure a presidential nomination from either major party.  ', '“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,” Harris said. “And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.” ', 'Harris was set to travel to the formerly Biden, now Harris, campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware on Monday afternoon, the White House said. Also Monday, the campaign announced it had raised $81 million in its first 24 hours.', 'Biden’s announcement came three and a half weeks after his halting and unsteady debate performance against former President Donald Trump, which spurred widespread panic among Democrats and calls from dozens of elected officials, donors and pundits for Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee. ', 'Because Biden dropped out before the Democratic National Convention (DNC), Democratic delegates are free to vote for other candidates, including Harris. Delegates will formally vote to select a new nominee either before or during the DNC, which will take place from August 19-22 in Chicago. ', 'Dozens of top Democrats, members of Congress and major organizations echoed Biden’s endorsement of Harris on Sunday as state parties mobilized ahead of the convention. Nearly 200 congressional and statewide elected officials and more than 250 Democratic mayors have endorsed Harris. On Monday morning, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, two names floated as potential running mate picks for Harris, joined in in endorsing her.', 'Tennessee Democrats became the first to formally pledge delegates to Harris, Reuters first reported.', 'Hendrell Remus, chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, told The 19th that in a previously scheduled delegation meeting, 70 delegates present out of 72 total voted for a motion to put their support behind Harris. (The two delegates not present were Rep. Steve Cohen, who expressed support for Harris on X, and former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore). ', '“There were no defections or dissension or major backlash,” Remus said in a brief phone interview. “I think we were all ready for this. We are all ready for this process to swiftly wrap up and to move on and to really support Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee.”', 'Harris had held several campaign events and fundraisers over the past weeks on behalf of the Biden campaign, assuaging Democratic voters and donors’ anxieties over Biden’s debate performance. On Thursday, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Harris held a rally slamming Trump’s pick of Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. Before Biden dropped out, the White House said Harris would be traveling to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for a campaign event on Tuesday. It’s set to be her first campaign event as Biden’s anointed presidential candidate and the Democrats’ leading choice.', 'By Sunday evening, the “Biden for President” campaign had filed with the Federal Election Commission to rename itself “Harris for President,” allowing the newly formed Harris campaign to assume control of all funds already raised. As of the end of June, this amount was north of $95 million. Small-dollar donors gave $52 million to Harris’ nascent presidential campaign through the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue as of 10 p.m. Eastern Time, the organization said, with donations pouring in before Harris sent out a fundraising email shortly before 8 p.m. on the way to the $81 million figure announced Monday.', 'Harris, 59, served as San Francisco district attorney and attorney general of California before being elected to the U.S. Senate from California in 2016. Biden selected her as his running mate when he ran for president in 2020, and their election to the White House made Harris the first woman and first woman of color to serve as vice president. ', 'Throughout her career, Harris has had a special focus on two issues that have been top of mind among many voters in this election cycle: abortion and gun violence. ', 'Harris is a strong supporter of abortion rights, an issue that she’s been far more comfortable openly championing than Biden, a Roman Catholic who personally opposed abortion rights for much of his political career and stumbled talking about the issue in the June 27 debate.', 'Over the past two years, Harris has been a leading voice opposing the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health that overturned the federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade. She has held numerous official and campaign events focused on reproductive rights and in March, became the first vice president to visit an abortion clinic in Minnesota. ', ' Last week in North Carolina, Harris took aim at the Trump-Vance ticket and Project 2025, a more than 900-page blueprint of far-right policies a future Trump administration could enact in a second term. Trump and his campaign have publicly distanced themselves from the effort, led by the Heritage Foundation, though some of its ideas are echoed in the Republican Party’s platform adopted at its convention in Milwaukee.', '“You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are intent on taking reproductive freedoms from the people of America and the women of America — trying to ban abortion nationwide, as they do, and restrict access to IVF and contraception, as their plan calls for,” Harris said Thursday.  ', 'She serves as the head of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, the first-ever such office established by a presidential administration. In this role, she has led national efforts to expand background checks and close gun show loopholes, has been vocal about her support of a federal red flag law, and has made a point of connecting with younger voters on their concerns about the ways in which gun violence has shaped the experiences of their generation. ', 'In March, Harris visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with a group of young adult survivors of the mass shooting that happened there in 2018. During the visit, she announced two proposals to help prevent school shooting incidents. One was the launch of the first-ever National Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) Resource Center, which serves as the first source of federal support for states in enforcing and implementing red flag laws. The other came from her calling on more states to pass red flag laws of their own and making funding and resources available to those that do so through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. ', 'The Office of Gun Violence Prevention has also worked with the Department of Education to encourage messaging about safe firearm storage as a safeguard against school shootings. ', 'Last year, Harris launched the Fight For Our Freedoms college tour, aimed at speaking directly to young voters about some of the most pressing issues for their generation: gun safety, reproductive rights, climate change and voting rights. In March, the Biden-Harris campaign launched a Students for Biden-Harris Initiative, at which time Harris cited the importance of mobilizing young voters in this election cycle. ', 'Share']"

One percent of voters surveyed said they’d opt for other presidential candidates, while an additional 2% said they were undecided.', 'The survey of 1,000 likely voters was conducted by the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs between July 9 and 18 — a volatile time in the presidential contest. It came as some senior Democrats intensified their push to drive the 81-year-old Biden from the race and also encompassed parts of the Republican National Convention and the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.', 'Polling numbers could shift now that Biden has stepped aside — and some leading Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and influential South Carolina U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn have already endorsed Harris.', 'Trey Hood, the UGA political scientist who oversaw the survey, noted that when he polled the Trump v. Harris question it was a hypothetical. Sunday’s news, he said, “certainly resets things.”', '“There’s going to be many decisions made by different people that are going to interact with one another, and who knows what the effects of all those decisions are going to be,” he said. “We don’t have enough information, including a definitive Democratic candidate, yet to really say a whole lot.”', 'Still, the poll suggests that Harris has ground to make up in Georgia, a crucial political battleground state that Biden narrowly carried four years ago, delivering the state to the Democrats for the first time in nearly three decades. As vice president, she has paid multiple visits to the state this year, shoring up support among Black voters.', 'The AJC poll found that independents, a crucial voting bloc in Georgia, sided with Trump by 11 percentage points. And a majority of respondents, nearly 53%, said they viewed Harris unfavorably, compared with 42% who said they had a favorable impression of her. Only 5% of those surveyed said they didn’t have an opinion. (More than 57% of respondents viewed Biden unfavorably, compared with 41% who saw him favorably.)', 'On the other hand, Harris polled higher than Biden among Democrats and Black voters, who represent the party’s base. (Nearly 92% of Democrats polled said they backed Harris over Trump, compared with Biden’s 86%. Almost 91% of Black respondents said they’d pick Harris rather than Trump, compared with Biden’s 82% share of the vote.)', 'Among the Black voters who say they will support the vice president is Vela McClam Mitchell of Smyrna.', '“She has qualifications. She understands the people. She understands the problems that we are all encountering, and I really think that she has put in the work,” the 69-year-old said. “I’m certain she will be an excellent president.”', 'The AJC poll found that the race between Trump and Biden was closer than it was with Harris. In a head-to-head matchup against the current president, 48% of Georgia voters polled said they’d back Trump, compared with 45% who would vote for Biden and 3% for another candidate. When the pollsters included independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Libertarian Chase Oliver by name, the race moved into a statistical tie between Trump and Biden, with 45% of respondents picking Trump and 42% Biden.', 'Among Democrats, Harris had almost 85% favorability. But there are some within the party who suggested they aren’t yet enthusiastic about her candidacy.', 'Danise Stewart of Roswell would have voted for Biden this fall but wasn’t excited about it. But the 62-year-old white woman, who works in sales and marketing, said she was “not really happy” with the job Harris has done as vice president.', '“I think she should have been down at the border more and done more,” Stewart said. “But I think she’s going to be energized now. And if she can turn back to her tough prosecutor self, I really think that it would do well for the Democrats.”', 'The poll, meanwhile, highlighted a key factor that’s buoyed Trump in Georgia. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans said they’re “very enthusiastic” about Trump’s chances. Hood, the UGA pollster, said that if Democrats can’t bridge that enthusiasm gap, “that could be enough to put Trump over the finish line in Georgia in this close contest.”', 'Among all voters surveyed, 50% said they viewed Trump unfavorably, and 48% said they had a favorable impression.', 'John Lamie, a disabled veteran from Quitman, has voted for Trump twice and says he will likely do so again this fall. Even though “Trump may not be the best person in the world,” Lamie doesn’t think Democrats will have enough time to adequately introduce a candidate to voters in time.', '“I’m only going to have, what, four months to get to know them? You need to know someone intimately and know what they stand for before voting for them for president,” the Republican said.', 'With Biden out of the race, Trump now becomes the country’s oldest-ever presidential nominee. But fewer than one-third of Georgia voters said they were concerned about the 78-year-old’s age, with more than 90% of Republicans answering that they’re “not too concerned” or “not concerned at all.” Meanwhile, two-thirds of likely Georgia voters said they were concerned that Biden, 81, was “too old” to be president, including 45% of Democrats.', 'The poll shows that Georgians are divided over the other leading political figures. About one-quarter of Georgia voters surveyed have a unfavorable impression of U.S. Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, while one-fifth give him positive reviews. The rest — about 54% — don’t know enough to have an impression.', 'And voters are split over Kennedy, with about 40% of respondents holding a positive view of him, 40% having a negative view and the remainder undecided. He polled highest among Republicans, independents and younger voters, while a plurality of Democrats and liberal voters see him unfavorably.', 'Trump is winning more than one-third of independent voters and has 90% Republican backing, while Kennedy’s strongest bloc of support is among liberals, 14% of whom are supporting him.', 'Voters in Georgia felt mixed about the historic nature of a potential Harris nomination to lead the Democratic Party: She would be the first Black woman and first Asian American to serve as the party’s choice for president.', 'To Portia Kendrick, 54, that’s not enough to garner her support. Although Kendrick is a Black woman, she said she would not vote for Harris.', '”The presidency is about more than race. It’s about who is the best person to lead our country,” the McDonough resident said. “I don’t think she is up for that task.”', 'Jermaine Bunch, 43, said he would support Harris “all the way.”', '“She’s been doing a great job in her role as VP,” Bunch said. “I know she would do great as the president.”', 'But as a Black man, he thinks he may stand alone in that view and worries the rest of the country would not be ready to embrace her candidacy.', '”We have come a long way from our civil rights era,” he said. “But since the election of President Obama, America has opened up a wound.”', '“There are many unresolved issues,” about race and gender, he said. He’s concerned that members of Congress would not give her the “leeway to be able to lead this nation.”', '”She would literally have to jump through hoops in order to prove herself worthy to so many people,” said Bunch, who lives in DeKalb County.', 'Staff writer Maya T.

The governor has urged Democrats to follow his winning formula by focusing on the everyday concerns of Americans, from good-paying jobs to quality education and health care.', 'Beshear, 46, supports abortion rights, but in Kentucky, he has tailored his message to push back against what he calls an extreme ban that lacks exceptions for rape and incest victims.', 'He won widespread praise for his empathy and attention to detail in guiding the Bluegrass State through the COVID-19 pandemic and leading the response to tornadoes and flooding that caused massive damage. He honed his speaking skills by holding regular news conferences that often last an hour or so.', 'Beshear has presided over record economic growth in Kentucky, and he typically begins his briefings by promoting the state’s latest economic wins. He frequently mentions his Christian faith and how it guides his policymaking.', 'A lawyer by trade, Beshear won election as state attorney general in 2015. He then unseated Trump-backed Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019.', 'Beshear entered politics with a strong pedigree as the son of two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, but has faced tougher political obstacles. Andy Beshear, unlike his father, has dealt with an entirely GOP-controlled Legislature and Republican lawmakers have stymied some of his priorities. One of them is state-funded preschool for every Kentucky 4-year-old.', 'The North Carolina governor has won six statewide general elections over two decades in a state where Republicans routinely prevail in similar federal races and also control the legislature.', 'Cooper, 67, has received strong job-approval ratings as governor, benefiting from a booming state economy for which his administration and lawmakers take credit. He also portrays himself as a fighter for public education and abortion rights. While Cooper finally persuaded GOP legislators last year to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, other efforts have been thwarted by a General Assembly with veto-proof majorities that has eroded his formal powers.', 'A native of small-town Nash County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Raleigh, Cooper was a high school quarterback and head of the Young Democrats at the University of North Carolina, where he obtained both his undergraduate and law degrees. “Coop,” as he was known to friends, came home and worked at his father’s law firm.', 'Cooper upset the Democratic incumbent in a 1986 state House primary race and was elected to the General Assembly.

In that post, he is likely best known nationally for declaring three former Duke University lacrosse players innocent after they were accused of sexual assault by an escort service dancer.', 'Cooper unseated another incumbent in 2016, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, by roughly 10,000 votes. A top campaign issue was the “bathroom bill” that McCrory signed requiring transgender people to use public restrooms that corresponded with the sex on their birth certificates.

This means the contaminated food may still be in circulation, and consumers should consider their personal risk level when consuming deli meats.', 'Federal health officials warned on Friday that the number of illnesses is likely an undercount, because people who recover at home aren’t likely to be tested. For the same reason, the outbreak may have spread wider than the states where listeria infections have been reported, mostly in the Midwest and along the U.S. eastern coast.', 'The largest number known to get sick — seven — were in New York, according to the CDC. The people who died were from Illinois and New Jersey.', 'Of the people investigators have been able to interview, “89% reported eating meats sliced at a deli, most commonly deli-sliced turkey, liverwurst, and ham. Meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis,” the CDC said.', 'And samples collected from victims from May 29 to July 5 show the bacteria is closely related genetically.', '“This information suggests that meats sliced at the deli are a likely source of this outbreak. However, at this time CDC doesn’t have enough information to say which deli meats are the source of this outbreak,” the agency said in a statement published on its website Friday.', 'Listeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food.', 'It can be diagnosed by testing bodily fluids, usually blood, and sometimes urine or spinal fluid, according to the Mayo Clinic.', 'Listeria infections are especially dangerous for people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Victims of this outbreak ranged in age from 32 to 94, with a median age of 75.', 'For pregnant people, listeria can increase the risk of miscarriages. One of the victims of the current outbreak was pregnant, but did not have a miscarriage, officials said.', 'Infections confined to the gut — intestinal listeriosis — can often be treated without antibiotics according to the CDC. For example, people might need extra fluids while experiencing diarrhea.', 'But when the infection spreads beyond the gut — invasive listeriosis — it’s extremely dangerous, and is often treated with antibiotics to mitigate the risk of blood infections and brain inflammation, according to the Mayo Clinic.', 'So far there’s no sign that people are getting sick from prepackaged deli meats. And for at-risk people who already have deli slices in their refrigerator, they can be sanitized by being recooked. “Refrigeration does not kill Listeria, but reheating before eating will kill any germs that may be on these meats,” the CDC says.', 'This isn’t new advice: The CDC says it always recommends that people at higher risk for listeriosis avoid eating meats sliced at the deli, or heat them to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit (74 Celsius) or until it’s steaming hot before eating.', 'Some of the products involved in past listeria outbreaks cannot be reheated, of course: Over the decades, listeria has provoked voluntary or mandated recalls of cheeses, bean dips, milk, mushrooms, packaged salads, and ice cream.', 'The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

According to the CDC, people who are not pregnant usually have fever, muscle aches and fatigue. They may also experience a headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance or seizures. Pregnant women may also experience similar symptoms, however listeria can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth. It can also cause serious illness or death in newborns.', 'Those who believe they are sick with listeriosis are asked to contact local or health officials to aid in identifying the specific deli products causing the illness.

We spoke with Arnold’s owner Larry Katz about how listeria can spread.', '“It can come from either the product itself, which most distributors would not know until something bad happens, or it can also come from wherever you’re slicing the cold cuts from,” Katz said.', 'Often times, deli meats pose a higher risk for listeria contamination compared to other types of deli meats due to various factors like processing and handling methods. Katz told us what precautions are taken in his store.', '“After every piece of meat that gets sliced, totally clean the machine and start over again. The other thing that we do is, every night, we’re done for the day, our whole deli room is cleaned, totally washed, cleaned, and then in the morning, we do it again just to double check and that helps a lot,” Katz explained.', 'The CDC has not issued a recall because it’s still unclear which products are contaminated with the bacteria causing the illness, meaning contaminated food may still be on the market. Katz said, luckily for them, they’ve never had an outbreak at their store due to their pristine hygiene practices and federal regulations they must abide by.', '“We buy all USDA inspected cold cuts and, again, we are federally inspected, so we have to do it by the federal rules and so do the companies we buy the cuts from, so we never had a problem,” Katz added.', 'In addition, how deli meats are stored is also important.', '“You have to keep cold cuts under refrigeration from the minute you take it out of the cooler to slice, from the minute you put it in the case to sell…definitely has to be refrigerated,” Katz noted.', 'The CDC said consumers, especially those at higher risk, should avoid eating deli meat unless it is reheated to a steaming hot temperature at home in order to reduce the risk of listeria infection.']"

According to a recent announcement from The Centers for Disease Control, there is currently a nationwide Listeria outbreak linked to deli meats sold nationwide.', 'Thus far, the outbreak has led to 28 reported illnesses and 28 hospitalizations across 12 states, as well as two deaths, though the actual number of people affected by this outbreak is likely much higher. The states that have been impacted so far are Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nThis deadly outbreak, which began in May, is still ongoing. While the CDC has yet to identify what deli product (or products) has caused the outbreak, the agency notes that “many people in this outbreak are reporting eating meats that they had sliced at deli counters.” Still, the outbreak has yet to be linked to any formal recalls.', 'Per the CDC’s announcement, Listeria among deli meat is not uncommon. “Products sold at the deli, especially those sliced or prepared at the deli, can be contaminated with Listeria. Listeria spreads easily among deli equipment, surfaces, hands, and food,” the agency declared. “Refrigeration does not kill Listeria, but reheating to a high enough temperature before eating will kill any germs that may be on these meats.” \n\nListeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. While healthy individuals may experience symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, a listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Symptoms usually start within two weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria, but may start as early as the same day or as late as 10 weeks after.', 'So, what should shoppers do? According to the CDC’s guidelines, anyone who is pregnant, 65 or older, or has a weakened immune system should not eat meats that have been sliced at any deli counter, unless the meat has been reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees, or until steaming hot. Additionally, since Listeria can grow on foods kept in the refrigerator, anyone in the above groups should clean their fridge, containers, and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats. If you’ve recently eaten deli meat and start experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.']"

Sick people’s samples were collected from May 29, 2024, to July 5, 2024. Of 28 people with information available, all have been hospitalized. One person got sick during their pregnancy and remained pregnant after recovering. Two deaths have been reported, 1 in Illinois and 1 in New Jersey.', 'What is Listeria?', 'Listeria is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that is ubiquitous and can grow under either anaerobic (without oxygen) or aerobic (with oxygen) conditions. ', 'A.        The Prevalence of Listeria in Food and the Environment', 'Listeriosis is one of the most important bacterial infections worldwide that arises mainly from the consumption of contaminated food.[1] The disease is caused by Listeria monocytogenes, which is considered an opportunistic pathogen that affects mainly those with underlying immune conditions, such as pregnant women, neonates, and elders, resulting in septicemia, meningitis, and/or meningoencephalitis. Of the six species of Listeria, only L. monocytogenes causes disease in humans. It thrives between bacteria 86-98.6oF (30-37oC), but Listeria can grow at temperatures as low as −0.4°C and survive in freezing conditions down to −18°C.[2] This unique quality allows thermal characteristics to be used as a means of differentiating Listeria from other possibly-contaminating bacteria. ', 'Listeria monocytogenes is omnipresent in nature; it is found widely in such places as water, soil, infected animals, human and animal feces, raw and treated sewage, leafy vegetables, effluent from poultry and meat processing facilities, decaying corn and soybeans, improperly fermented silage, and raw (unpasteurized) milk.[3]', 'Foodborne listeriosis is relatively rare but is a serious disease with high fatality rates (20%–30%) compared with other foodborne microbial pathogens. Severe L. monocytogenes infections are responsible for high hospitalization rates (91%) among the most common foodborne pathogens, may cause sporadic cases or large outbreaks, and can persist in food-processing environments and multiply at refrigeration temperatures, making L. monocytogenes a significant public health concern.[4]', 'Ready-to-eat foods are a notable and consistent source of Listeria. For example, a research study done by the Listeria Study Group found that L. monocytogenes grew from at least one food specimen in the refrigerators of 64% of persons with a confirmed Listeria infection (79 of 123 patients), and in 11% of more than 2,000 food specimens collected in the study. Moreover, 33% of refrigerators (26 of 79) contained foods that grew the same strain with which the individual had been infected, a frequency much higher than would be expected by chance. The danger posed by the risk of Listeria in ready-to-eat meats prompted the USDA to declare the bacterium an adulterant in these kinds of meat products and, as a result, to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of this deadly pathogen. The Code of Federal Regulations includes requirements for the post-lethality control of Listeria in meat and poultry products. This regulation is referred to as “The Listeria Rule” and was enacted in 2003. The rule outlines prevention and control measures that must be taken in processing facilities to reduce the risk of contamination of ready-to-eat products.[5]', 'B.        Transmission of and Infection with Listeria', 'Listeria typically spreads to people through contaminated food or water but can also be transmitted from mother to fetus.', 'Except for the transmission of mother to fetus, human-to-human transmission of Listeria is not known to occur. Infection is caused almost exclusively by the ingestion of the bacteria, most often through the consumption of contaminated food. The most widely accepted estimate of foodborne transmission is 85-95% of all Listeria cases. ', 'The infective dose—that is, the number of bacteria that must be ingested to cause illness—is not known but is suspected to vary based on the strain. In an otherwise healthy person, an extremely large number of Listeria bacteria must be ingested to cause illness—estimated to be somewhere between 10-100 million viable bacteria (or colony forming units “CFU”) in healthy individuals, and only 0.1-10 million CFU in people at high risk of infection. Even with such a dose, a healthy individual will suffer only a fever, diarrhea, and related gastrointestinal symptoms.', 'The amount of time from infection to the onset of symptoms—typically referred to as the incubation period—can vary to a significant degree.[6]', 'According to the CDC, symptoms of Listeria infection can develop at any time from the same day of exposure to 70 days after eating contaminated food. According to the FDA, gastroenteritis (or non-invasive illness) has an onset time of a few hours to 3 days, while invasive illness can have an onset varying from 3 days to 3 months. According to one authoritative text:', 'The incubation period for invasive illness is not well established, but evidence from a few cases related to specific ingestions points to 11 to 70 days, with a mean of 31 days. In one report, two pregnant women whose only common exposure was attendance at a party developed Listeria bacteremia with the same uncommon enzyme type; incubation periods for illness were 19 and 23 days.', 'Adults can get listeriosis by eating food contaminated with Listeria, but babies can be born with listeriosis if their mothers eat contaminated food during pregnancy. The mode of transmission of Listeria to the fetus is either transplacental via the maternal bloodstream or ascending from a colonized genital tract. Infections during pregnancy can cause premature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, or serious health problems for the newborn. Pregnant women make up around 30% of all infection cases while accounting for 60% of cases involving the 10- to 40-year age group.', 'C.        Who is most susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes infection?', 'Several segments of the population are at increased risk and need to be informed so that proper precautions can be taken. The body’s defense against Listeria is called “cell-mediated immunity” because the success of defending against infection depends on our cells (as opposed to our antibodies), especially lymphocytes, otherwise known as “T-cells.” Therefore, individuals whose cell-mediated immunity is suppressed are more susceptible to the devastating effects of listeriosis, including HIV-infected individuals, who have been found to have Listeria-related mortality of 29%. The incidence of Listeria infection in HIV-positive individuals is higher than in the general population. One study found that:', 'The estimated incidence of listeriosis among HIV-infected patients in metropolitan Atlanta was 52 cases per 100,000 patients per year, and among patients with AIDS it was 115 cases per 100,000 patients per year, rates 65-145 times higher than those among the general population. HIV-associated cases occurred in adults who were 29-62 years of age and in postnatal infants who were 2 and 6 months of age. ', 'Pregnant women naturally have a depressed cell-mediated immune system. While other systemic bacterial infections may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes at comparable frequencies, L. monocytogenes have notoriety because fetal complications largely occur in the absence of overt illness in the mother, delaying medical intervention. In addition, the immune systems of fetuses and newborns are very immature and are extremely susceptible to these types of infections. ', 'Other adults, especially transplant recipients and lymphoma patients, are given necessary therapies with the specific intent of depressing T-cells, and these individuals become especially susceptible to Listeria as well. Other adults, especially transplant recipients and lymphoma patients, are given necessary therapies with the specific intent of depressing T-cells, and these individuals become especially susceptible to Listeria as well.', 'According to the FDA, CDC, and other public health organizations, individuals at increased risk for being infected and becoming seriously ill with Listeria include the following groups:', 'D.        Symptoms of Listeriosis', 'Only a small percentage of persons who ingest Listeria fall ill or develop symptoms. For those who do develop symptoms because of their infection, the resulting illness is either mild or quite severe, in what is sometimes referred to as a “bimodal distribution of severity.”[7] Listeria can cause two different types of disease syndromes with differing severity. Non-invasive Listeria infection causes gastroenteritis with symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting that resolve on their own. Healthy adults without any immunocompromising conditions typically experience this milder version of the disease. The more severe type of disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes is called listeriosis and is referred to as an invasive illness. ', 'On the mild end of the spectrum, listeriosis usually consists of the sudden onset of fever, chills, severe headache, vomiting, and other influenza-type symptoms. Along these same lines, the CDC notes that infected individuals may develop fever, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. When present, the diarrhea usually lasts 1-4 days (with 42 hours being average), with 12 bowel movements per day at its worst.', 'The more severe form of the illness occurs when the bacteria infect parts of the body that are typically sterile, such as the blood, brain, liver, and cerebral spinal fluid. The presence of the bacteria in these areas triggers the immune response and can lead to those more severe symptoms. L. monocytogenes has a specific affinity for the central nervous system (CNS), especially in cell-mediated immunodeficient individuals.[8]', 'As already noted, when pregnant, women have a mildly impaired immune system that makes them susceptible to Listeria infection. If infected, the illness appears as acute fever, muscle pain, backache, and headache. The illness usually occurs in the third trimester, which is when immunity is at its lowest. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature labor, miscarriage, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth. Around twenty percent of such infections result in stillbirth or neonatal death. ', 'Newborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days) or late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the early-onset form are often diagnosed in the first 24 hours of life with septicemia, meningitis, or respiratory distress and have a higher mortality rate. Early-onset listeriosis is most often acquired through trans-placental transmission. Late-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common and less severe than the early-onset form. Clinical symptoms may be subtle and include irritability, fever, poor feeding, and meningitis. The mode of acquisition of late onset listeriosis is poorly understood. ', 'E.        Complications of Listeria Infection', 'For those persons who suffer a Listeria infection that does not resolve on its own, the complications can be numerous and possibly severe. The most common complication is septicemia (bacterial infection in the blood), with meningitis being the second most common. Other complications can include inflammation of the brain or brain stem (encephalitis), brain abscess, inflammation of the heart-membrane (endocarditis), septic arthritis, osteomyelitis (infection in the bone), and localized infection, either internally or of the skin. ', 'Death is the most severe consequence of listeriosis, and it is tragically common. The CDC has estimated that L. monocytogenes is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness, with approximately 260 of 1,600 people diagnosed dying from their infections. For example, based on 2018 FoodNet surveillance data, 96% of 126 Listeria cases ended up in the hospital, the highest hospitalization rate for pathogenic bacterial infection. This data showed a fatality rate of 21%. According to the FDA, the case-fatality rate increases substantially based on complications, possibly reaching rates of 70% in cases with listeria meningitis, 50% in septicemia cases, and over 80% for perinatal/neonatal infections. In one US study, L. monocytogenes was reportedly the cause of nearly 4% of all cases of bacterial meningitis.19', '[1]           Reda, W.

Candidate lists are vetted by the Kremlin; fundraising is both limited and enabled by the Kremlin,” he said.', 'He explained Russian candidates are only allowed to campaign within red lines set by Putin and don’t really expect to win the election - which means they won’t say anything too controversial like criticising the war in Ukraine.', '“The opposition candidates are being careful not to be any more aggressive than Putin is in his campaigning.

Putin, 71, will undoubtedly win a fifth term, with none of the three other candidates who are permitted on the ballot presenting a real challenge. The main opposition figure who worked to spoil the vote, Aleksei A. Navalny, a harsh critic of Mr. Putin and the Ukraine war, died in an Arctic prison last month.', 'Still, the vote is significant for Mr. Putin as a way to cement his legitimacy and refurbish his preferred image as the embodiment of security and stability. That image was tarnished when the war, advertised as a speedy operation to topple the government in Kyiv, turned into a slog that caused hundreds of thousands of casualties, ruptured relations with the West and ushered in harsher domestic repression.', '“The Kremlin needs to demonstrate huge popular support, and that this support has increased since the beginning of the war,” said Nikolay Petrov, a Russian political scientist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.', 'The Kremlin habitually ensures that Mr. Putin faces no real competition. The other candidates — all members of the State Duma, Russia’s rubber-stamp Parliament — voted for the war in Ukraine, for increased censorship and for laws curbing gay rights.', 'Nikolai Kharitonov, 75, of the Communist Party, already lost badly to Mr. Putin in 2004.', 'Leonid Slutsky, 56 of the Liberal Democratic Party, a nationalist group loyal to Mr. Putin, has said he will not rally voters against the president.', 'Vladislav A. Davankov, 40, from the New People Party, is nominally liberal and has called for “peace” in Ukraine but has basically supported Mr. Putin.', 'Two candidates opposed to the war were disqualified. A veteran politician, Boris Nadezhdin, alarmed the Putin administration when tens of thousands of people across Russia lined up to sign petitions required for him to run. The Kremlin invalidated enough signatures to bar him.', 'Russia held real elections for about a decade after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Ever since, the Kremlin has relied on various social, geographic and technical levers to ensure that its candidate receives an overwhelming majority.', 'Although Mr. Putin enjoys some support, the Kremlin has long sought to proclaim that he received more than 50 percent support in balloting, and also more support than he did in each previous vote. This year that means outstripping the 56 million votes that the authorities said he received in 2018; pundits are betting on 60 million.', 'Two important changes this time could add to the vote’s opacity.', 'For one, balloting will be held in the so-called “new territories,” the four Ukrainian regions Moscow annexed without fully controlling them. Russia’s election officials say the area has 4.5 million voters, an assertion virtually impossible to monitor amid a war.', '“We cannot check the figures there and the authorities will use them as they wish,” said Alexander V. Kynev, an independent election expert in Moscow.', 'Also, the ability to vote online will be more widely available, with electronic voters in 29 regions on one huge list, with no means to check where or how they voted, Mr. Kynev noted.', 'In a sprawling, diverse country like Russia, the Kremlin can also use more traditional means. Regions dominated by ethnic strongmen, like the Caucasus, habitually report huge turnouts with Mr. Putin receiving 99 percent of the vote — even if relatively few people show up at polling stations.', 'Areas where state industries prevail also tend to report heavy support for the president. To turn out the vote, some polling stations hold raffles for prizes like household appliances or firewood. One Siberian region is offering 16,000 prizes.', 'But the Kremlin must rely on some votes in big cities, and that can get tricky. Excessive manipulation has created unrest previously. There might be slightly more manipulation this year because monitors are barred unless issued credentials by the candidates.', 'With street demonstrations banned, some Putin opponents hope to cast protest votes. The simplest method to lower his tally is to vote for someone else, experts noted.', '“Noon Against Putin,” a campaign pushed by Mr. Navalny’s organization, suggests swarming polling places at midday on Sunday. But there are a number of hurdles, including possible confrontations with the police.', 'Also, in previous votes, few polling stations had more than 3,000 registered voters and many had fewer than 1,000. “It is technically very complicated to create a crowd,” said David Kankiia, an analyst with the Golos election watchdog, barred in Russia.', 'Since he was first appointed successor to President Boris Yeltsin in 2000, Mr. Putin has said Russia’s Constitution would dictate the length of his tenure. Then he kept rewriting the Constitution.', 'Asked in 2014 whether he would remain president forever, Mr. Putin responded, “This is not good and it is detrimental for the country and I do not need it either,” before adding, “We will see what the situation will be like, but in any case the term of my work is restricted by the Constitution.”', 'In 2008, when term limits forced him to step aside, he became prime minister under President Dmitri A. Medvedev, although Mr. Putin remained the power behind the throne until reclaiming the top job in 2012.', 'Presidential terms were extended to six years before the 2018 vote, and then in 2020 Mr. Putin changed the constitution again to reset his term clock. At this point, he can have at least two terms until 2036. If Mr. Putin lasts, he will soon outstrip the record, 29-year rule of Joseph Stalin.', 'The tally is expected to be announced sometime Sunday night Moscow time.', 'Putin, in Pre-Election Messaging, Is Less Strident on Nuclear War', 'A Collective ‘No’: Anti-Putin Russians Embrace an Unlikely Challenger', 'Russia Bars Antiwar Candidate in Election Putin Is All But Sure of Winning', 'Milana Mazaeva, Alina Lobzina and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.', 'An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which Vladimir V.

What will that mean for his country and the West?', 'POLITICO illustration; Photos by AP, Getty Images', 'Casey Michel is author of the forthcoming book Foreign Agents: How American Lobbyists and Lawmakers Threaten Democracy Around the World, and is currently the director of the Human Rights Foundation’s Combating Kleptocracy Program.', 'This weekend, Vladimir Putin will win another election as Russia’s president. The election will, of course, be rigged in Putin’s favor, just as all of his past elections have been, but Putin is all but assured to claim another six-year term, taking him to at least 2030.', 'Yet for all that inevitability, Putin’s next term as president has been the focus of surprisingly little discussion, including what it is likely to mean both inside and outside Russia. And that’s all the more surprising given that Putin’s regime is arguably more destabilized now than it’s ever been, with little end in sight for Russia’s growing economic troubles or the spiraling deaths on the battlefields of Ukraine. Since last summer alone, Russia has seen a sudden mutiny, led by a renegade militia that nearly marched on Moscow; rampaging anti-Semitic riots, with security services nowhere to be found; and protests erupt in normally placid places like Bashkortostan.', 'No one can say what these events portend. But it’s clear that the war in Ukraine has helped make Russia’s domestic situation more unstable than it’s been in decades, and all kinds of potential future scenarios are no longer unthinkable.', 'So it’s a good time to think about them. In at least considering the paths below — and the likelihood of their arrival in the not-too-distant future — the West can begin preparing accordingly, especially in terms of strategy and policy. We know much about Russia’s past and plenty about Russia’s present. But what about Russia’s future?', 'Below are five scenarios that Russia might (or might not) experience by the end of Putin’s next term in 2030.', 'While Alexei Navalny may have been the most prominent leader of democratic movements in Russia, killing him will hardly eliminate pro-democratic energies in the country. | Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images', 'Why It Might Happen: As the anti-communist, anti-colonial revolutions in 1989 across Eastern Europe illustrated, totalitarian regimes can rest on quicksand and quickly crumble in the face of democratic movements. Putin’s disastrous decision-making in Ukraine has already had unforeseen knock-on effects, which will only continue to generate discontent moving forward — and more interest in potential alternatives, including outright democracy.', 'And that was true even before Alexei Navalny’s suspicious death in prison. While Navalny may have been the most prominent leader of democratic movements in Russia, killing him has hardly eliminated pro-democratic energies in the country. With Navalny transformed from a campaigner into a martyr, such momentum for democratic reform — even democratic revolution — might actually begin building anew. As a prisoner, Navalny was out of sight, and largely out of mind for most Russians. But as a symbol of the lengths Putin’s regime will go to snuff out any opposition, Navalny may now become something more.', 'Combined with the other protests still gurgling around Russia, not least those organized by soldiers’ mothers and wives, a sudden burst of democratic momentum around the country is now possible. Nothing would be more of a testament to Navalny’s life, and to Navalny’s legacy.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: As much as many in the West would like to see a full flourishing of democracy in Russia — whether led by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, or someone else — the likelihood of such a scenario playing out before 2030 is minimal. And that was the case even before Navalny’s death. Now, with the leader of Russian democratic hopes suddenly snuffed out, any chance at rallying Russians to a democratic cause has almost certainly died with him, at least for the foreseeable future.', 'Just look at where Russia is. Navalny is, in many ways, irreplaceable, just as jailed pro-democratic figures like Vaclav Havel or Nelson Mandela before him were irreplaceable, and whose countries’ democratic transformations happened only after they were freed. The rest of Navalny’s pro-democracy infrastructure has been effectively undone, stamped out by Putin’s repression. And even with the shock of Navalny’s death still settling, the Russian body politic has hardly evinced any interest in liberal democracy anyway. Rather than rallying to his cause, many have simply shrugged their shoulders at Navalny’s demise, and gone on with their lives. The same goes for hopes of rising opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; even two years into Putin’s disastrous war, the majority of Russians are still passively, if not actively, supportive of the unprovoked invasion.', 'What the West Should Do: The best hopes for a democratic Russia lie, perhaps ironically, not in Russia itself, but in Ukraine. Just as colonial failures in places like Angola and Algeria led to democratic, post-imperial reforms in places like Portugal and France, so too could a Ukrainian victory kill off Russian nationalism and Russian revanchism — and finally spur the kind of democratic flourishing Navalny called for.', 'If this scenario does come to pass, it’s incumbent on the West to return to an old strategic staple: trust, but verify. Don’t get overexcited about Russia’s democratic prospects — a mistake far too many in the West made in the 1990s — but encourage what you can. Be open to lifting sanctions and hydrocarbon price caps, but only in return for concrete reforms and prosecutions of Putin-era officials. All the while, keep building out relations with Russia’s neighbors and former colonies, places like Moldova and Armenia.', 'Perhaps above all else — and as sacrilegious as it may sound right now — don’t put your hopes in a single leader. Navalny was the clear lodestar for Russian democratic hopes, but even he had his nationalist weaknesses, claiming, for instance, that Crimea is rightfully Russian. If nothing else, Navalny should be the last singular Russian figure so many in the West place hopes of democratic reform on — a belief that has burned the West in the past and that led the West to miss just how ingrained Russian imperialism still is.', 'A Dagestan officer kicks the body of a Chechen fighter in the village of Pervomaiskaya after the Russian grueling assault on Jan. 19, 1996. | Serguey Chirikov/AFP via Getty Images', 'Why It Might Happen: Picture this: on the back of a devastating war, with hundreds of thousands of Moscow’s troops slaughtered in a meaningless fight, Russians turn out to protest en masse, and overthrow an aging, doddering regime. Long-buried frictions and frustrations ripple across the country and a nation supposedly united under the steady hand of Moscow suddenly splinters along ethnonationalist lines. Chaos sprints across the nation, which collapses into a mixture of anarchy, territorial fragmentation, and violence that leaves no region, and no family, untouched.', 'Sound farfetched? Think again. This is, after all, precisely what happened in Russia in the late 1910s and early 1920s, when the tsarist collapse ripped apart the Russian Empire, with peoples and polities across Eastern Europe and the Caucasus and northern Asia all declaring independence — only for most to eventually be gobbled up by a rising Soviet regime.', 'This is also what we saw following the Soviet collapse (albeit with far less violence), when new nations claimed their sovereignty following the USSR’s collapse — and not just in places like Ukraine or Kazakhstan. Residents in Chechnya voted for clear independence, while those in Tatarstan voted for equal footing with the Russian Federation. Residents in places like the Siberian nation of Sakha signed agreements for an independent army, while residents in the Buddhist nation of Tuva unleashed anti-Russian violence that bordered on outright pogroms. State fracture — and independence for nations long colonized by Moscow, but still largely unfamiliar to the West — stalked the Russian Federation.', 'Could it happen again? Perhaps not immediately. But Russia remains a conglomerate of 21 republics, dozens more regions, and even more nationalities with uncountable grievances against Moscow. The longer the war continues — and the more these colonized minorities are tossed into Putin’s meat grinder, slaughtered at far higher rates than ethnic Russians — the likelihood of such a scenario increases. Perhaps in the republic of Chechnya, its leader — an increasingly unhealthy Ramzan Kadyrov — dies in office and infighting over a successor spirals into a third Chechen War. Perhaps in Muslim-majority Tatarstan, veterans’ committees and local students gather to protest both Moscow’s recruitment of Tatar infantry and smothering of Tatar identity — and the Kremlin, in a fit of failed strategy, opens fire on the protesters, sparking a broader anti-colonial movement. Or perhaps, in Sakha, the unemployed storm and seize control of Russian hydrocarbon infrastructure, demanding the funds be returned to their colonized nation, and demanding the sovereignty they agreed to in the early 1990s.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: Many Russian analysts still view this scenario as farfetched, given Putin’s grip on power. And they’re not necessarily wrong; aside from Chechnya, no clear thirst for outright independence is evident, even in those nations watching their men be massacred in Ukraine. Recent protests in places like Dagestan and Bashkortostan, for instance, weren’t solely about independence but included economic and environmental grievances as well.', 'Still, dismissing this scenario out of hand would be unwise. All it takes is a spark, and the tinder that Putin has built up over his quarter-century in power could go up in flames — a likelihood that only grows alongside Putin’s disaster in Ukraine.', 'What the West Should Do: The West should stay flexible and remain mindful that the Russian Federation is hardly a homogenous entity. It should encourage democratic forces around the country, including in those that emerge in nations long colonized by Moscow, while training far more speakers of languages like Chechen, Sakha and Tatar. It should also lean on those who successfully safeguarded the Soviet Union’s nuclear arsenal during the Soviet collapse, making sure their expertise is implemented yet again. And it should prepare to be comfortable with territorial reorganization across the Russian Federation — a country that still refuses to recognize its own colonial legacies, which are only going to become more trenchant as the years pass.', 'While Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group never quite reached Moscow, that wasn’t for lack of opportunity; if anything, the path was wide open. | Vasily Deryugin/Kommersant Publishing House via AP', 'Why It Might Happen: A year ago, the idea that a renegade militia led by a frothing nationalist could nearly march on Moscow, sending Russian officials scurrying for cover, was fantasy. Not that it hadn’t been done before; the so-called “Kornilov Affair” of 1917, and even the failed hardliner coup of 1991, showed what a move could potentially look like. But under Putin, the idea that Russian nationalists might congeal and storm Moscow long seemed laughable.', 'And then, last June, militia head Yevgeny Prigozhin did just that. And while Prigozhin’s Wagner Group never quite reached Moscow, that wasn’t for lack of opportunity; if anything, the path was wide open. If Prigozhin accomplished anything, it was that he made Putin look like a tsar with no clothes.', 'Of course, Prigozhin is no longer around — his plane exploded over Russian airspace a few months later, killing him and much of his inner circle in what is widely assumed to be Putin’s retribution. But all of the ingredients that fueled Prigozhin’s rebellion are still there: frustration with Putin’s bungled invasion; the ongoing stripping of Russia of men and material in order to continue a quagmire; and the kind of spiraling wealth inequality that’s launched populists and revolutionaries around the world before.', 'For those reasons, this appears to be one of the likelier scenarios facing a post-Putin Russia. The flames of nationalism, stoked by Putin, will hardly subside anytime soon.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: Still, a scenario like this is hardly inevitable. Prigozhin himself was almost one-of-a-kind — a chef-turned-oligarch willing to publicly break with Putin’s cabinet, and even insult the president himself, all while building out a globe-spanning militia from Ukraine to central Africa. At the moment, there’s no other force that can compare to Prigozhin’s Wagner Group, much of which has been dismantled and subsumed by the state.', 'Plus, if anything, Putin is only getting more nationalistic as the war drags on, leaning further and further into outright fascism. Outflanking Putin from the right is only going to get more difficult, especially as he continues descending into the world of nationalistic conspiracies.', 'Want to read more stories like this? POLITICO Weekend delivers gripping reads, smart analysis and a bit of high-minded fun every Friday. Sign up for the newsletter.', 'What the West Should Do: If and when a more nationalistic figure or cadre replaces Putin, the West should continue to strengthen and expand sanctions, lower the hydrocarbon price caps, build out diplomatic and security relations with Russia’s neighbors, especially those (like Ukraine) directly targeted by Russian nationalists — all of it part of a broader package of policies. Call it, if you will, containment — a policy that helped hem in Soviet expansionism and could once more help to rein in an expansionist Moscow.', 'Smoke rises from a building in Bakhmut, site of the heaviest battles with the Russian troops in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. | Libkos/AP', 'Why it might happen: We’re now two years into Moscow’s failed invasion of Ukraine, and the impact in Russia is already obvious. And those costs, whether in terms of a sagging economy or spiraling body counts, will continue piling up. Which is why the idea of an inner circle of Kremlin officials meeting with Putin and informing him that they appreciate his service, and that they wish him well in retirement — a redux of Nikita Khrushchev’s 1964 ouster, in other words — is a scenario only rising in likelihood as time goes on.', 'Indeed, there’s a distinct likelihood that by 2030, a new regime will emerge in Russia. (Not that it needs to lead an internal conspiracy against Putin; the aging dictator could, of course, just die in office, and save us all the trouble.) The new government wouldn’t be democratic, necessarily. But it would be headed by a small number of Western-trained, technocratic elites, who would start out saying many of the things Western officials and businessmen, eager to get back to a kind of status quo antebellum, love to hear. They would put much of the blame for the war on Putin alone, promising a return to a sense of normalcy in Moscow. They might go so far as to free certain political prisoners and opposition politicians, or even rescind Putin’s 2022 announcement of annexations in eastern Ukraine (though not Crimea).', 'All the while, they would call for something that many Western politicians would welcome: “reset.” A chance to start over. To start fresh. And to pledge a new Russia moving forward.', 'Why It Might Not Happen: With apologies to Isaac Newton, there’s an iron law of authoritarianism: a dictator in power tends to stay in power. In other words, wresting control from a dictator like Putin always requires significantly more planning, energy and resources than the incumbent leader needs to thwart any internal conspiracy. It’s not that surprising, when you think about it, given that a dictator like Putin still holds all the levers of the state — and cultivates competition among his underlings, who would be eager to rat out any anti-Putin plotting. Toss in the fact that Putin still appears to have wide support among Russian officialdom — not least because, given the state of the war in Ukraine, Russia might actually win — and hopes of a Khrushchev-style ouster are hardly a safe bet.', 'What the West Should Do: If this actually were to happen — if a new, technocratic elite manages to wrest control from Putin — the West’s policy formula should be a flip of the strategy for actual democratic transition. That is, the West must distrust, but verify. If nothing else, Western officials should remember that every time a “reset” approach with Russia has been pursued, the West ended up appearing foolish, myopic, or both. For that reason, any calls for a renewed “reset” should be treated with severe skepticism. And while democratic reforms should obviously be encouraged and incentivized — especially as it pertains to lifting restrictions on civil society or Russia paying reparations for Ukraine — any improvements should be treated as temporary. After all, we’ve seen this story before, and we’ve seen how, time and again, it ends.', 'Vladimir Putin’s grip on power still appears strong — but there are plenty of factors that will make his next term far different, and potentially far more difficult, than anything he’s seen previously. | Mladen Antonov/AFP via Getty Images', 'Why It Might Happen: This was always going to be the likeliest scenario, wasn’t it? Barring unforeseen health events, and especially given the U.S.’s newfound squeamishness on backing Ukraine, Putin can look at his new presidential term as something that he will likely serve out entirely, and potentially far beyond.', 'And understandably so. With the death of Navalny, the democratic opposition is in shambles. The Russian economy, despite a barrage of Western sanctions, has hardly collapsed, even if it’s turned sluggish. Although Putin hasn’t conquered Kyiv, the worst of the Ukrainian war may yet be behind him, especially given the U.S.’s reticence to arm Ukraine. And compared to American presidents, at just 71, Putin’s still got (relative) youth on his side.', 'He’s already become one of Russia’s longest ruling leaders, with plenty of presidential terms behind him. Looking ahead to 2030, why would anything change?', 'Why It Might Not Happen: Putin’s grip on power still appears strong — but there are plenty of factors that will make his next term far different, and potentially far more difficult, than anything he’s seen previously. Take the economy. While Putin’s managed to ride out the sanctions against Russia thus far, the economy as a whole is clearly heading for both stagnation and rising inflation. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Putin’s missteps have already resulted in staggering casualty numbers. Either ingredient would be enough to threaten any leader, no matter how authoritarian. Escaping the vise of both is going to stretch Putin’s dictatorial toolkit further than ever before.', 'What the West Should Do: Ratchet up the pressure, wherever and however it can. Continue and enhance the sanctions, including against third parties in places like the United Arab Emirates that are helping Moscow skirt sanctions. Strengthen the hydrocarbon price caps, which have already drained revenue to the Russian state, and seize outright all of the frozen Russian Central Bank assets. Deepen partnerships with those on Russia’s periphery, especially as it pertains to encouraging democratic developments.', 'And, perhaps most of all, recognize that so long as Putin remains in power, Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine will continue, with threats of far broader warfare hanging in the offing. The West should use every tool it can find to force Russians — both those in the Kremlin and the broader populace itself — to realize how much better off they, and the rest of us, will be when Putin is no longer in power.', 'Gripping reads, smart analysis and a bit of high-minded fun.

Official results say he received 87% of the vote, which is the highest margin of any presidential election in Russia. What he will do with that enormous influence is the subject of much speculation now.', 'TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — To no one’s surprise, President Vladimir Putin secured another six years in power in a preordained election landslide that comes amid the harshest crackdown on the opposition and\u202ffree speech since Soviet times.', 'The three days of balloting, in which Putin faced three token contenders but none offering voters any real choice, went ahead with barely any independent monitoring and were marked by a level of pressure unseen in previous Russian elections. That left little room for protests, but some Russians still tried to defy authorities.', 'Some key takeaways from the election:', 'The Central Election Commission said Putin received 87.28% of the vote, the highest number for any president in post-Soviet Russia. It said turnout was 77.44% of the electorate, also the biggest. Others on the ballot all finished in single digits, and anti-war candidates were not allowed to run.', 'The state news agency RIA Novosti said the vote “as expected ... took place in an atmosphere of unprecedented national unity.”', 'There was no video from CCTV cameras at polling stations depicting voter fraud or ballot-box stuffing -– access to the footage was more heavily restricted than in previous elections -– and hardly any independent monitors were on hand to document irregularities.', 'There still was voter intimidation, however, according to Golos, Russia’s prominent independent election watchdog, noting it received reports of citizens being pressured to vote in over 60 Russian regions. On Sunday, voters were searched at polling stations, and some reported police checking their ballots before they were cast or peering over their shoulder while they filled them out, Golos said.', '“Nothing like that has happened on such a scale at elections in Russia before,” Golos said in a statement Monday. A total of 89 people were detained Sunday in 22 cities, said OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests.', 'The 71-year-old Russia leader “chose to show his adversaries his power,” said political analyst Abbas Gallyamov, a former Putin’s speechwriter.', 'Vandalism also was reported at polling stations, with arson attempts or some pouring ink into ballot boxes. On Sunday, a woman who set off a firecracker in a polling station bathroom was injured. At least 34 people were detained on vandalism charges over the weekend, according to Russian independent news outlet Verstka.', 'The Kremlin has severely crippled the Russian opposition in recent years. Top figures are either in jail or in exile abroad, and the death last month of Alexei Navalny, who was Putin’s most vocal opponent, raised even more questions about what lies ahead for them.', 'On Sunday, some Russians turned up at polling stations at home and abroad at noon local time and formed long lines in a strategy endorsed by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny and other Putin adversaries.', 'Analysts had said the “Noon Against Putin” tactic would test how well exiled opposition figures could rally supporters amid the crackdown that has largely scared people off from staging mass demonstrations.', 'Its success was hard to gauge. Navalny’s team shared photos of lines at polling stations in Russia and embassies abroad as proof that many heeded their call. Journalists from The Associated Press and other independent media spoke to voters in multiple locations who confirmed they showed up to take part in the protest.', 'But Russian officials and state media interpreted the lines in their favor, saying they indicated an increased interest in the election.', 'This protest couldn’t have had any direct implications for the Kremlin and the election’s outcome, but it did show that such “silent resistance” — both inside the country and abroad — will continue, said Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.', '“The message to political manipulators has been sent: ‘We are here, this is what we are like, we’re not giving up, we’re prepared to be creative in using unexpected windows (of opportunity to protest),’” Kolesnikov said.', 'In a post-election news conference, Putin looked relaxed, Gallyamov noted, probably realizing that “he has secured his future for at least six years ahead.”', 'Demonstrating his confidence, Putin even referenced Navalny by name -– something he had made a point of not doing in public in years -– and revealed that days before his foe’s death, he supported the idea of releasing him from prison in a prisoner exchange.', 'There likely will be a period where officials will take some time off to celebrate the victory, Gallyamov said, but after that, unpopular moves could be in store.', 'After his reelection in 2018, Putin famously raised the age for which workers could receive their pensions, a decision that proved truly unpopular and prompted protests.', 'Decisions were made before this year’s election “to keep the lid on public discontent,” such as preventing price increases and not announcing another mobilization of troops for Ukraine, but all that could change now, he said.', 'The crackdown on dissent also is expected to persist.', 'Some analysts suggest Putin might further test NATO’s resolve during his fifth term.']"

Putin won the contest with over 87 percent of the vote, with a reported 77 percent turnout. The record post-Soviet win was Putin’s choreographed attempt to demonstrate his popularity — and that of the war in Ukraine. But it is impossible to take much away, given the level of repression in Russian society and Putin’s ambition to make himself synonymous with the Russian state.', 'The results come just a month after the death of Putin’s most potent and vocal foe, the anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, while he was serving a 19-year sentence in an Arctic penal colony on multiple charges including extremism. It’s also a little over two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Russia refers to as a “special military operation.” Western countries have backed Ukraine during the grueling two-year war and imposed heavy sanctions on Russia, but those efforts have done little to loosen Putin’s grip on power; on the contrary, Putin’s government is at its most repressive since he first took power in 2000.', 'Even before his fifth term starts, Putin will already be the longest-serving Russian leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. If he serves out the entirety of this six-year term, he will surpass Stalin and be in the running next with Catherine the Great and then perhaps eventually Peter the Great — two rulers whose imperial power Putin has sought to mimic in his conquest of Ukraine and other former Soviet and imperial lands.', 'With his reelection, Putin will be in power till at least 2030, unless he dies or is somehow removed from power in the intervening six years.', 'Putin’s ruthless quest to build power — not only his own, but Russia’s — might come as a surprise to anyone who saw him when he first became president in 2000.', 'An unknown, unmemorable bureaucrat from St. Petersburg who served in the Soviet spy agency in Dresden during the tail end of the Cold War, Putin hardly seemed poised to gain the near-total power he now has in Russia.', 'But through a combination of immense wealth, cronyism, fraud, increasingly cruel repression, and constant information warfare, Putin has consolidated his power over the past 24 years, even when his deputy Dmitry Medvedev was nominally in charge.', 'Putin came into incredible wealth following the collapse of the Soviet Union and was appointed acting president in 1999 after Boris Yeltsin resigned. He was officially elected in 2000, serving his constitutionally mandated two terms — and even seemed more willing to cooperate with the West during that time. But he was also displaying imperial ambitions, fighting wars in Chechnya and Georgia.', 'After Medvedev pushed through a constitutional change allowing additional presidential terms, Putin regained the presidency in 2012. Amid the most fervent protests against the autocratic and corrupt regime, his government began instituting and escalating brutal crackdowns on minority groups like the LGBTQ population, opposition members, and civil society to entrench a narrative of Russian tradition.', '“In the 1990s–2000s, Russia experienced a range of issues such as economic and demographic crises and the loss of its impactful role on the international stage, causing the perceived ‘emasculation’ of the population,” Radzhana Buyantueva, a researcher studying LGBTQ communities in Russia and their intersection with the political sphere, explained to Vox over email in December. “The Kremlin has utilized these insecurities in its anti-gender queerphobic propaganda,” cracking down on LGBTQ groups and other perceived opponents while also militarizing society and “culminating in the escalating military aggression toward neighboring states (Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014).”', 'Putin also systematically undermined or eliminated political opposition, cementing his hold on power not just through a popular narrative about Russia’s national identity, but also with election fraud, murder, poisonings, draconian jail sentences, and other political repression.', 'Over the past year, the Kremlin quashed multiple attempts to compete against him in this weekend’s elections. Though three competitors did stand in this year’s contest, they were all state-backed and lacked any real popular support. There were multiple true opposition candidates with demonstrated popular support — like Boris Nadezhdin, an anti-war candidate — who attempted to stand against Putin this year but were barred from doing so.', 'Now, almost anyone who would vocally oppose or present an alternative to Russian propaganda has been silenced or has fled.', 'Will you help keep Vox free for all?', 'At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

Putin’s most formidable opponent, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic gulag — or was killed, in effect, by the system — a month ago. In the past, the Kremlin allowed some selected opposition candidates to stand in presidential ballots in a semblance of competition. This time, Boris Nadezhdin — whose campaign some initially suspected was sanctioned from on high — was barred by the authorities after his anti-war stance showed signs of drawing significant support.', 'The Putinist system may, like the late Soviet one, be more brittle than it appears; when the mutinous warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin briefly marched towards the Kremlin last June, some liberal critics saw it as the beginning of a collapse they had long forecast. Since Prigozhin’s not-so-mysterious death in a plane crash, Putin seems to have regained his grip, despite signs of official jumpiness around the election.', 'The west’s ability to influence developments inside Russia is limited. It must do more, though, to squeeze Moscow’s war machine by enforcing sanctions better, and to persuade developing countries of the need to implement them too. The biggest task is to rebuild western defences as a deterrent — and to give Ukraine all the support it needs. Ensuring Putin does not prevail there is the best way to deter him from going further. And the failure of his misbegotten war remains the one thing most likely to prevent his fifth term from extending into a sixth.']"

Only four leaders of modern Russia and the USSR have left the top job alive; the rest have died in office of natural or other causes.', 'Moreover, Putin’s actions over the past two years have been directed at moving Russia from authoritarianism to semi-totalitarianism. The Carnegie Endowment’s Andrei Kolesnikov has written persuasively of these tectonic shifts that recall the darkest years of Soviet Stalinism.', 'Putin has explicitly presented his war of choice in Ukraine as a proxy for a wider, long-term conflict with the West. He believes the West is irresolute, in decline, and easily distracted and deflected.', 'Former US President Donald Trump’s “have at them” attitude towards US allies and partners, and the woeful Western vacillation over further military aid to Ukraine, will only embolden Putin further. Buoyed by his ritual success in this weekend’s election, he will embark on further risky and provocative adventurism.', 'Read more: What can we expect from six more years of Vladimir Putin? An increasingly weak and dysfunctional Russia', 'Consequently, Putin – and the ideology of “Putinism” – pose a serious challenge for Western governments and policymakers who are genuinely accountable to their electorates, the party room, the parliamentary opposition, a vocal and inquisitorial media and an independent judiciary.', 'As exiled Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar has argued, part of Putin’s statecraft is directed at making common cause with ultra-conservative Western political elements to contest global “wokeness”, demobilise support for Ukraine, and dull resistance to Russian territorial ambitions in its neighbourhood.', 'Putin is well aware that the inherent fractiousness of democracy and the need to court the fickle voters hobbles democratic governments’ long-term planning.', 'Moreover, our political culture is predisposed to wanting to “solve” issues. Sometimes, though, problems of the scale posed by Russia or the Middle East can only be managed, not solved – and then only through joint efforts with like-minded allies and partners. That requires persistence and resilience to rise above short-term politicking and the twitches of our “instant expert” social media culture.', 'It also demands constant investment in building and sustaining public understanding of what really is at stake, beyond the borders of Europe that were drawn in the bloodshed and misery of the second world war.', 'This is difficult anywhere, not least in the West, where we have had it comparatively easy for most of the post-second world war era. We need stalwart and principled leadership now more than at any other point in the last 50 years. Most of all, we need ongoing serious and informed public conversations about what we value in and wish for in democratic societies, and the price we are willing to pay to attain and preserve that.', 'Read more: Why the US and its partners cannot afford to go soft on support for Ukraine now', 'That sort of discourse can be hard to generate in our politically rather apathetic society. However, it is vital when the institutions of our democracy are barraged by foreign information manipulation and interference designed to sow doubt and distrust and corrode popular faith in the integrity of our form of government.', 'Especially in Australia, we have allowed our already limited pool of Russia expertise to atrophy to near-extinction. It is well past time to re-invest, modestly but purposefully, in Russian language and associated studies at our universities. We need to boost “Russia literacy” and comprehension of a country that will remain a significant and disruptive player in the world. This matters to countries that matter to us.', 'We should also honestly and critically assess the mistaken assumptions and indifference that at times have undermined effective Western policies towards post-Soviet Russia. However, we should not succumb to the propaganda peddled by Putin and his proteges abroad that Moscow is a blameless victim of Western perfidy and deception aimed at destroying the Russian state.', 'Rather, as Australian professor Mark Edele writes in his recent book, Russia’s War Against Ukraine:', 'Russia never came to terms – either as a society or as a polity – with its transformation from a continental empire with global reach into a nation-state and a regional power.', 'The Kremlin is marketing Russia as an ally of “the Global South” in resisting resurgent neo-colonialism and championing “multipolarity”.', 'The Putin thesis is that Ukraine is a patsy of London and Washington, while Moscow is on the side of the formerly colonised. That argument is finding some ready ears, evident in the patchy support for sanctions on Russia. We cannot assume our own Indo-Pacific region is persuaded of the wrongness of the Kremlin’s claims.', 'The reality confronting us is that of a sullen and resentful Russia, convinced that history, morality and even divinity is on its side in a de facto existential war with the West.', 'Moreover, as Bristow, my former colleague in Moscow, has written:', 'we would be unwise to assume that a rising generation of Russians will embrace a more democratic and pro-Western outlook.', 'Yet, we must not turn away from those Russians – far from an irrelevant minority – who do not share Putin’s view that the future of their country lies in the perceived glories of its past. The challenge is to articulate what a better future would look like for Russia, beyond confrontation, and to keep that alternative clearly in view.', 'Write an article and join a growing community of more than 180,300 academics and researchers from 4,910 institutions.']"

That was a little short of the 87.3 percent that Putin registered across the board.', 'In Tajikistan, which hosts a Russian army base, more than 9,500 people voted.', 'One section of the voters there were Tajiks with dual citizenship. Although such things are hard to gauge in the absence of polling data, it appears pro-Putin sentiments are typically strong in Tajikistan.', 'A Eurasianet correspondent said turnout may also have been aided by the spread of rumors that anybody failing to cast their ballot might face complications in trying to enter Russia in future.', 'In Uzbekistan, around 4,600 Russian nationals reportedly voted at polling stations in Tashkent and Samarkand. Reporters on the ground said they saw long lines, although it appears they too were mainly there to register their backing for Putin.

', 'Since Russia’s last presidential election in 2018, the authorities have adopted more than 11 amendments to the country’s election laws aimed at “limiting the voting rights of citizens” and “reducing opportunities for public oversight,” according to Golos. ', 'Among those changes, it singled out the 2020 constitutional amendments as the most harmful, as they allowed Putin to reset his term count and remain in power until 2036. ', 'At the same time, Golos said the introduction of multiday and online voting in recent years has made it much more difficult for independent monitoring of the voting process, all the while making electoral fraud easier. ', 'So, too, has Russia’s law on “foreign agents” — which has impacted hundreds of NGOs, news outlets, journalists, activists and cultural figures — marred elections by limiting their ability to take part in political life.', 'Voters were subjected to “unprecedented pressure” during this year’s presidential election as the Kremlin sought to achieve a record turnout. ', 'Golos said it received reports of citizens being coerced into voting from at least 60 regions across Russia, mostly among public sector workers, employees of state-linked corporations, as well as workers at some private businesses. ', 'Information obtained by the watchdog indicates that state-linked entities in Moscow were provided lists of employees who cast their ballots online. ', 'The 2024 presidential race was the first in Russia’s history to take place without the presence of OSCE election monitors. Instead, the Russian authorities invited handpicked “international election experts” whose credibility was suspect. ', 'In several Russian regions, candidates and the parties they represent refused to register their own independent observers, while in some areas authorities moved to recall observers’ registration after the start of the voting period, according to Golos.', 'Some independent electoral observers were removed from polling stations by force and subjected to searches and detentions, while those permitted to stay were barred from moving around polling locations, as well as from taking photos and recording videos of suspected irregularities.  ', 'Golos received reports of voting irregularities from 45 regions, according to Monday’s report. Among the irregularities identified by the watchdog were ballot stuffing, “carousel voting” and the improper storage of ballots overnight. ', 'Fraudulent votes amounted to at least 31.6 million — or nearly half of all ballots cast for Vladimir Putin — according to estimates by Novaya Gazeta Europe. ', 'Golos said the March 15-17 election was “characterized by unprecedented levels of violence and emotional tension.” ', 'Following multiple reports of dye-spilling incidents and arson attacks at polling places, Russian officials increased the presence of law enforcement at voting stations. ', 'In Moscow, as well as the Irkutsk region and the republic of Udmurtiya, voting booths were dismantled at some polling stations and police were reportedly spying on voters’ ballots, according to Golos. ', 'At least 22 people were arrested over attempts to spoil ballots with dye, while 12 others were detained for trying to set polling stations and individual ballot boxes on fire, according to Golos. ', '“Golos definitively condemns these practices, which obstruct the [voting] results... and violate the voting rights of citizens. No political or personal motives can justify such actions on the part of voters,” the watchdog said.', 'As you may have heard, The Moscow Times, an independent news source for over 30 years, has been unjustly branded as a ""foreign agent"" by the Russian government.

About 99.4% of the votes had been counted. This marks a record win for Putin, who took home 77% of the vote in 2018.', ""There was never any doubt Putin would win at the ballot box. His opponents — who are far from Putin's level of clout and influence — were pre-approved by Russia's election commission and posed no serious challenges to the incumbent leader."", 'A main challenge for Putin was, in fact, just getting a high voter turnout.', 'The Russian state was actively involved in that undertaking, with civil servants and state-linked companies pressuring employees to cast their ballots. Some staffers were also expected to bring family members along and had to share their geolocations with their bosses via a special app, independent Russian media outlets reported.', 'David Szakonyi, a political-science professor at George Washington University, told Business Insider last week that voter turnout was an extremely important metric for Putin.', 'Szakonyi said the facade of a free and fair election was important to Putin because it would show Russians and the rest of the world that he had been democratically elected and had a ""natural and justified defensible place in Russian politics.""', 'Szakonyi said that with the presidential election behind him, Putin would be turning his attention back to the war in Ukraine because winning the war was still his top priority.', 'That means Russia is expected to keep producing and sourcing more military goods, in turn boosting the economy and further consolidating support for Putin.', ""Putin's victory has much to do with how his administration managed to steady Russia's economy and keep Russians on a relatively stable footing over the past two years amid the war."", ""Merely winning has never been enough for Putin — and this year's presidential election is no different"", ""Putin is promising Russians billions of dollars of lifestyle improvements — but it's unclear where all that money will come from"", ""Russia's economy appears resilient, but companies are going bankrupt by the hundreds"", ""Russia's GDP grew 3.6% in 2023.

According to election officials, turnout exceeded 77 percent, and Putin took home roughly 87 percent of the vote — breaking all records in the history of modern Russia. Having topped the official results of the election Aleksandr Lukashenko stole in Belarus in 2020, Putin’s latest win is drawing comparisons with autocratic leaders in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, who typically claim more than 90 percent of the vote. For the inside scoop on what Kremlin officials think about the voting results, Meduza special correspondent Andrey Pertsev spoke to sources close to the Putin administration, a political strategist, and regional officials. Here’s what they said.', 'The Putin administration’s political bloc actually exceeded the targets set for the 2024 presidential vote. As Meduza reported previously, Kremlin officials tasked Russia’s regional governments with securing 70 percent voter turnout and 80 percent support for Putin. According to one election strategy document obtained by Meduza, the leadership of one Russian region set themselves this exact target and planned to achieve it primarily through mobilizing public sector employees and the employees of companies close to the state.', 'But in the weeks before the vote, the Putin administration began to express a “desire” for the incumbent to win upwards of 80 percent, two regional officials told Meduza on condition of anonymity. As a result, 80 percent support was perceived as an absolute minimum and many regions decided to aim for 85. As a Meduza source close to the administration put it, the head of the Kremlin’s political bloc, Sergey Kiriyenko, really “wanted to show the president very high numbers — and that’s what he did.” ', 'At the same time, a political strategist working with the Putin administration in one Russian region highlighted another contributing factor in the sky-high results for Putin: Russia’s far eastern regions “set the bar to wow,” prompting the rest of the country to follow suit. “The Far East tallies the results earlier and then the other regions want to show better numbers,” he explained. ', 'Indeed, most of the regions in Russia’s Far Eastern Federal District reported that Putin won more than 85 percent of the vote. The Khabarovsk Krai, which Kremlin officials consider a “protest region,” was the exception, reporting 80 percent support for Putin. ', 'A regional official also told Meduza that Putin’s envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District steered local administrations towards the target of 85 percent. The presidential envoy, Deputy Prime Minister Yury Trutnev, “wanted to demonstrate that the Far East is the president’s base and not an opposition territory,” the official said. ', 'Kremlin officials don’t see a problem with Putin achieving such high numbers. Two sources close to the Putin administration told Meduza that Kiriyenko is pleased with the election results and doesn’t consider them “overkill or falsified bullshit.” According to a source close to United Russia’s leadership, Kiriyenko has already made personal phone calls to most of Russia’s governors to thank them for their help in the elections. ', '“No matter what anyone says [about regional officials] ‘overdoing it’ or ‘going overboard,’ they won’t be punished for a victory. The Supreme Leader likes it; he perceives this as real support. [Kiriyenko] knows how to present it to him and sell it, that’s the main thing,” said a source close to the Kremlin. ', 'Another source close to the Putin administration drew special attention to the results reported in Moscow. According to election officials, Putin won more than 85 percent of the vote in the capital — a number just below the national average. “Before there was a gap — [it was] more than five percent in the last campaign. Now Moscow is an exemplary, loyal region. [Mayor Sergey] Sobyanin can sell this to the president as his [personal] achievement; he pacified the capital,” the source said. ', 'The runner-up in the election, Communist Party (KPRF) candidate Nikolai Kharitonov, netted 4.31 percent of the vote. New People Party candidate Vladislav Davankov and LDPR leader Leonid Slutsky scraped up 3.85 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. This means that all three of Putin’s “challengers” surpassed the required threshold for their parties to receive around 500 million rubles ($5.4 million) in federal funding. ', 'Your help can be the bridge to hope for many in Russia. Join Meduza in its mission to challenge censorship with the truth. Donate today.', 'Initially, the Putin administration hoped Slutsky would come in second, but after he failed on the campaign trail, the Kremlin didn’t bother to significantly rig the vote in his favor. On election day, Meduza’s sources close to the presidential administration said that Davankov was most likely to take second place, but they also said that Kharitonov still stood a chance. ', '“Davankov wouldn’t have been prevented [from coming in second]. In many regions he really did come in second place, but he fell short. And the KPRF’s electorate of true believers came out in support of Kharitonov. Plus, he was a more comfortable [candidate] for the administrations of the southern regions and national republics, where Davankov is an obscure [figure],” explained a source close to the Kremlin. ', 'Pro-Kremlin media, he added, still plans to spin Kharitonov’s results as a defeat for the KPRF, underscoring that the party achieved “a record low result and didn’t reach 10 percent.” ', 'As Meduza reported previously, Kremlin officials weren’t overly concerned with who would be the runner-up. “They didn’t interfere with Kharitonov either,” the source said. “Second place with four percent isn’t second place with 10 percent. All [the candidates were] equally weak — except the one in first place.” ', 'Story by Andrey Pertsev', 'Translation by Eilish Hart ', 'Underreported stories. Fresh perspectives.

NASA has put up STL, GLB and OBJ files of the 3D printable reliefs.', 'The 3D printable files can be obtained from this page, after scrolling past the individual images used to make the composite versions, or you can download them from the table above. The 3D printable reliefs are only available for the composite versions of the images. Users can either import the downloaded files directly into the software for 3D printing, or edit them first a 3D editing software such as Blender or 3D Studio Max. The reliefs are in two aspect ratios, square and rectangular, with the names of the targets on the top of the plates. There is plenty of granular detail in the images, which is why a resin printer is recommended for the job.']"
